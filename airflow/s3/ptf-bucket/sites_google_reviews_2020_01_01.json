Their seating is limited but you can always take your food to go and eat in the food court, any seating areas.","pics":[{"url":["https:\/\/lh5.googleusercontent.com\/p\/AF1QipNQwhbIJa1OntN3zXc6nL6kS46xFF3A47mNhkSk=w150-h150-k-no-p"]},{"url":["https:\/\/lh5.googleusercontent.com\/p\/AF1QipNowTpCfGm96HREzeHS6pXjXDiY2owysasJ2_mf=w150-h150-k-no-p"]},{"url":["https:\/\/lh5.googleusercontent.com\/p\/AF1QipOhjj9G1OfquxpzREVQVXp8Zm8XyyAhDvKpaVY_=w150-h150-k-no-p"]},{"url":["https:\/\/lh5.googleusercontent.com\/p\/AF1QipNconQWCOGwulQUbrf7JaUMvDI1w7OYd9ot0MOC=w150-h150-k-no-p"]},{"url":["https:\/\/lh5.googleusercontent.com\/p\/AF1QipNaZH0cSXQSmjmP3pZywID5RY2lxQHm6EINCKYV=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}],"resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x80c2dbc77eff87c5:0x89f6ab0aed6d867b","anio":2021,"mes":6,"dia":24,"estado":"California"},{"user_id":"105498900864948938940","name":"Amy Alderson","time":1622665697121,"rating":5,"text":"Fantastic!

I decided to give it another try since the first time I had the food to go. The items seemed decent the first time but had been in the car for a while and reheated, so I wanted to get a real experience before reviewing the place.\n\nOn my first visit the food ordered was a 3\/5 spice wise, and was very spicy. This time however the 3\/5 was barely noticeable. My first visit I had the Beef Pad Thai and Beef Salad (yum nua). This visit I decided to try the Beef Pad See Ewe.\n\nThe prices on the food are a bit high in comparison to other places locally, but the portion sizes are decent. I was however surprised on this visit when my Pad See Ewe came out prepared with Pad Thai noodles rather than wide flat noodles. The flavor of the dish was decent, but inconsistent from bite to bite, with some having good flavor, while the majority of the others lacking. It was almost as if it needed more sauce when cooked and that salt was unevenly distributed in the food.\n\nThe restaurant was nice inside, I observed the staff cleaning and sanitizing tables immediately after customers left, and the menu selection is pretty decent.\n\nMy biggest criticism would be that the food is priced on the higher end, but I feel other places locally have better flavor.","pics":[{"url":["https:\/\/lh5.googleusercontent.com\/p\/AF1QipOtUE3qsaz8kQQJYjLgD6ViqXtjKBMM6mbZ7yxG=w150-h150-k-no-p"]},{"url":["https:\/\/lh5.googleusercontent.com\/p\/AF1QipPD0y1zp3xFacj7WAttV6wEPUxM61u7l3hrMlA-=w150-h150-k-no-p"]},{"url":["https:\/\/lh5.googleusercontent.com\/p\/AF1QipMuCxAK6TUn1Uf9_atmwXGT03HqdbMYhe5SDerk=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}],"resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x865c8940c0af4267:0xd79d5e7344028316","anio":2021,"mes":5,"dia":16,"estado":"Texas"},{"user_id":"117106118738471169339","name":"Peter C Nehen","time":1627093556795,"rating":5,"text":"Exceptionally tasty food, with good service and the room was very tastefully done.\n\nFood was very eye catching as well.

There were a few children there but i personally have no problem with parents trying to balance thier profession and childcare. Side note: the kids were SO well mannered, not at all in the way and even did their best to help. While i was sitting down the youngest one offered me something to drink, she was adorable.

In the last year the fire alarms have gone off constantly and at random times of the night. They also charge fees for everything and are not flexible vs the old property managers that would provide 1-2 day grace periods, etc. We will not be re-signing which is unfortunate because we really liked this community when we first moved here.\n\nWe\u2019ve had a broken parking garage door for months (still broken as of today) which is a major safety concern and the apartment gym is always out of cleaning supplies which is unacceptable considering the current state of affairs. The fobs into the building work half the time and I can\u2019t tell you how many times they\u2019ve had issues with elevator maintenance. The hallway carpets are not cleanly.

Horrible first impression for a place that just opened its doors a few weeks ago.","pics":null,"resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x864e7f6dddb0db03:0x97d98afb22ee99e","anio":2021,"mes":9,"dia":1,"estado":"Texas"},{"user_id":"108972068814489567711","name":"Darren H","time":1630873761281,"rating":5,"text":"Great Variety and Friendly Service!","pics":null,"resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x864e7f6dddb0db03:0x97d98afb22ee99e","anio":2021,"mes":9,"dia":5,"estado":"Texas"},{"user_id":"110157547004189624886","name":"Breana","time":1629509578203,"rating":5,"text":"Their staff is super friendly and helpful!!","pics":null,"resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x864e7f6dddb0db03:0x97d98afb22ee99e","anio":2021,"mes":8,"dia":21,"estado":"Texas"},{"user_id":"112198880379028414958","name":"Joseph Blaylock","time":1629009320900,"rating":5,"text":"Very friendly and helpful staff","pics":null,"resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x864e7f6dddb0db03:0x97d98afb22ee99e","anio":2021,"mes":8,"dia":15,"estado":"Texas"},{"user_id":"104841243381088172996","name":"Brandon Wilks","time":1628993671236,"rating":5,"text":"Nice selection","pics":null,"resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x864e7f6dddb0db03:0x97d98afb22ee99e","anio":2021,"mes":8,"dia":15,"estado":"Texas"},{"user_id":"110015199431033079347","name":"Red Vines","time":1631046848758,"rating":5,"text":"Fantastic selection and amazing customer service.","pics":null,"resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x864e7f6dddb0db03:0x97d98afb22ee99e","anio":2021,"mes":9,"dia":7,"estado":"Texas"},{"user_id":"118431800367235780828","name":"Pharcus Winjammer","time":1629477582760,"rating":4,"text":null,"pics":null,"resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x864e7f6dddb0db03:0x97d98afb22ee99e","anio":2021,"mes":8,"dia":20,"estado":"Texas"},{"user_id":"102251080761379121388","name":"Anne Gautsche","time":1628561212848,"rating":5,"text":null,"pics":null,"resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x864e7f6dddb0db03:0x97d98afb22ee99e","anio":2021,"mes":8,"dia":10,"estado":"Texas"},{"user_id":"108843454151081934236","name":"William Hopgood","time":1629493520537,"rating":3,"text":null,"pics":null,"resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x864e7f6dddb0db03:0x97d98afb22ee99e","anio":2021,"mes":8,"dia":20,"estado":"Texas"},{"user_id":"117790489530128317580","name":"lilly conyers","time":1629504997691,"rating":5,"text":null,"pics":null,"resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x864e7f6dddb0db03:0x97d98afb22ee99e","anio":2021,"mes":8,"dia":21,"estado":"Texas"},{"user_id":"110121245781358101646","name":"Kass","time":1630019900268,"rating":5,"text":null,"pics":null,"resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x864e7f6dddb0db03:0x97d98afb22ee99e","anio":2021,"mes":8,"dia":26,"estado":"Texas"},{"user_id":"111488201856753992482","name":"Michelle Bell","time":1630752212787,"rating":5,"text":null,"pics":null,"resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x864e7f6dddb0db03:0x97d98afb22ee99e","anio":2021,"mes":9,"dia":4,"estado":"Texas"},{"user_id":"102199166377549888075","name":"Isidro Gutierrez Jr","time":1629927008439,"rating":5,"text":null,"pics":null,"resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x864e7f6dddb0db03:0x97d98afb22ee99e","anio":2021,"mes":8,"dia":25,"estado":"Texas"},{"user_id":"116437771564571318064","name":"Albert Aldana","time":1630118060565,"rating":5,"text":"Great environment and you really learn so much from master Kim","pics":null,"resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x865c6766df139545:0xdbd4d6528fc3ca62","anio":2021,"mes":8,"dia":28,"estado":"Texas"},{"user_id":"108971551611701850178","name":"Raymundo Castaneda","time":1620705589577,"rating":5,"text":"(Translated by Google) Excellent place I recommend it \ud83d\udc4d\n\n(Original)\nExcelente lugar se los recomiendo \ud83d\udc4d","pics":null,"resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x866f945967c2e08f:0x1d8b594fd2bc01fa","anio":2021,"mes":5,"dia":11,"estado":"Texas"},{"user_id":"108971403196446594717","name":"Ken Johnson","time":1617290989738,"rating":5,"text":"MrsTasha my barber always hooks me up.

Kylie Galvez assisted me with finding The Palazzo, and I completed everything online.\n\nFast forward - I\u2019ve had absolutely 0 concerns since I\u2019ve moved into my unit.  During the unexpected Winter Storm Uri, in February 2021\u2026I\u2019m sure none of us ever want to remember this.  Anyway, I applaud the community for their updates and for offering the residents assistance and\/or credits if they chose to find an alternative place to live until our utilities were restored or damages were repaired.  I chose to ride out the storm and stayed in my place.  Unfortunately, my building sustained damage but my unit was not effected.\n\nMoving on - I read comments about parking but this issue has been addressed and residents can now call Bexar Towing.  There are also signs posted for individuals to text to park.  There were a couple of times when people parked in my space and I just followed protocol, no biggie and I received an immediate response.\n\nOKAY!

I was furious. When I spoke with Abdul he claimed that he only test drove the car to check the vibrating that I asked him to check. I refused to believe that. Then he claimed that he used my car to run errands while supposedly checking the vibrating. I was so upset that he agreed to compensate me $200. Okay fine. A couple of days later, I got an email from my insurance company stating that an estimate was submitted for $217 from this mechanic. I called him and he stated there was missing parts. I picked up my car on Friday and he made the claim on the following Monday. I told him that he didn't want to eat his wrong doing and made my insurance company pay for it.

All positives.  I highly recommend them.  I usually call Biggs first for anything to get his opinion.  The only work he hasn\u2019t done for me is related to my Evinrude motor fuel injectors because apparently you need a certified mechanic to work on them.\n\nI was looking for a general boat mechanic in Matagorda a few years ago and somebody told me about Biggs. So I put his number in my phone, and about two years ago before I even used them, I broke down in the ICW and called him out of the blue. So he ran out and towed me in, tried a few things to get me going, and charged me a very reasonable price for all of that.\n\nLater that year, I needed some general work so I gave him my key to my boat storage shed and they picked up my boat, did the work, and returned it.\n\nIn 2020, I had the power pole bowl break on the transom mount and I called them while on the water. I brought it over to them immediately, and they noticed the bolt was the standard bolt and they drilled it out and replaced it with a heavy duty bolt.  Didn\u2019t know that was an option.  That was the second time I snapped that bolt.\n\nEarly in 2021, I gave them a laundry list of items to fix, mostly electrical. Again, they picked up my boat fix 8 or 9 things quickly and called me when they were done. All without me driving down there.\n\nExcellent service.  Extremely responsive for a small town mechanic. That\u2019s not meant to be a critical comment.  We all know things move slower the closer you get to relaxation and the water.  Biggs always calls me back or responds.

I was at Madisonville Care Center as a rehab patient for 12 days in February, 2021.  The food was absolutely terrible!  If you read their web site, it says something about \u201cdelicious\" food.  Don\u2019t believe it.  Locals will tell you they are not known for their food.  In addition, due to the bad weather we had, the meals got skimpier and skimpier because they were probably running out of food.  The bad weather was well predicted ahead of time.  Someone should have ordered in extra provisions and made an emergency plan.  Most of the employees were wonderful!  Helpful, cheerful, proficient, efficient and caring.  Some were not.  One aid would \u201cplay dumb\u201d as if she didn\u2019t hear me or didn\u2019t understand.  One aid yelled at me because I was hollering \u201chelp\u201d.  You try being left on the toilet for an extended period of time and see how you like it.  The facility was inadequately staffed on Saturday night before Valentines Day.   I understand that folks want to be off and have plans, but it was poor planning and irresponsible to deliberately leave your facility understaffed.  One nurse took one look at me and decided she didn\u2019t like me.  Dr. Fields, the wound care doctor, needs to find a different line of work.  He should have recognized and told me right away that my leg wounds were caused by insufficient blood flow in my veins.  Dr. Fields actually discouraged compression bandaging, which was exactly what I needed.  I am extremely bitter over this.  I wasted 6-8 weeks and endured untold misery because he is either inept or dishonest.  The second wound care doctor I saw in Huntsville recognized my problem as soon as he saw it.  Calling their home office or customer care number is a huge joke.  YOU WILL NEVER RECEIVE A RESPONSE.  Don\u2019t even bother calling.   The residents seemed happy and engaged.   One big plus, my husband was allowed to visit me after he had a negative covid test.  All in all, the facility is not that bad, but I would suggest you plan on visiting your loved one as often  as allowed and supplement their food.","pics":null,"resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x8646454f95a3e533:0x7415f79760760b84","anio":2021,"mes":5,"dia":16,"estado":"Texas"},{"user_id":"107194632738186908419","name":"Chance Dean Evans","time":1621575167360,"rating":5,"text":"April thank you so much you were total sweetheart and did amazing they are luck to have you on there team or maybe it\u2019s us","pics":null,"resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x86464ff825d4afe9:0xc9d5c7705a9325","anio":2021,"mes":5,"dia":21,"estado":"Texas"},{"user_id":"102950010003031356507","name":"ceila Lopez","time":1628616787603,"rating":5,"text":"(Translated by Google) Very excellent personal attention, very trained\n\n(Original)\nMuy excelente atencion personal muy capacitada","pics":null,"resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x86464552b3539a31:0xdfd15490ccdb59f1","anio":2021,"mes":8,"dia":10,"estado":"Texas"},{"user_id":"110321955591815830050","name":"Darwin Corcorran","time":1628213179445,"rating":4,"text":null,"pics":null,"resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x86464552b3539a31:0xdfd15490ccdb59f1","anio":2021,"mes":8,"dia":6,"estado":"Texas"},{"user_id":"116312573758087866868","name":"AlyCadabra","time":1612891513305,"rating":5,"text":null,"pics":null,"resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x86464552b3539a31:0xdfd15490ccdb59f1","anio":2021,"mes":2,"dia":9,"estado":"Texas"},{"user_id":"115085796418329530895","name":"richard s","time":1619718926324,"rating":1,"text":"Do not trust this builder.

We did run into a couple of construction mishaps between Hauk and their subcontractors, but they were corrected without question. I would definitely choose both him and Tim again. The only disappointment was setting expectations up front. We were told it would be a couple of months to finish construction after the design process and it took at least six months to finish.

I myself, was there as a patient, got some tests done to see about my thyroid. I was not in the state to get my results in person, I called them to let them know to see if I could get them thru the phone, I NEVER GOT THOSE RESULTS even tho I called every other day to speak with the doctor.The most recent problem I'm still having, mind you, I already changed pediatricians again, is they keep charging me for a balance that I have already paid and I have receipts of. They kept sending letters to pay up or my account would be sent to collections, and  I kept calling them to let them know what's up, (always a struggle to get thru the phone with them) they would tell me to just disregard the letters. Now I'm getting letters from a collection agency! I have never been late on any kind of payment and have not left anything unpaid. And they still tell me to just disregard the letter! What the hell!

The same rude woman screamed from the clinic's door entrance inviting me only (not my caregiver) to come in to supposedly evaluate me prior seeing the doctor and insisted that my caregiver should remain outside until I met with the doctor. Just to make it clear both ( me and my caregiver had proper protective gear: 3 layered mask covering with filter, gloves and eye protection)\n\nI tried to explain to her the need of my caregiver to be with me at all times and she then responded  \"ARE YOU COMING IN OR NOT\".\n\nDr. Ellant please be advised that I made a huge effort based on my disability and urgent referral to meet with you and due to your inconsiderate, rude inflexible attitude of the management  staff working at your clinic  I had no choice to take care of my well being rather than keep being mistreated by asking to be submitted to suden whims of such unprofessional and selfish staff.\n\nIs unfortunate whether or not you are directly or indirectly responsible for the poor initial service new patients requiring your specialty have to walk away with.\n\nI would advise you to really take into consideration the bad experience I went through by addressing immediately the nasty attitude receptionists have at this location otherwise these type of incidents will continue to happen.\n\nI am in complete agreement that \"we all have the right to remain safe by any potential exposure to the covid-19  and as patients in need to medical professionals like you.... we are doing our part; if the clinic space is too small and the management staff is not empathetic to patients' needs then consider a way of resolving all these by not booking so many patients at once for such a small clinic and changing your management staff to people with the right kind attitude to represent you.\n\nTo all potential patients take into consideration my experience it could also happen to you.","pics":null,"resp":{"time":1616794351954,"text":"CJ, we sincerely apologize for your recent visit with us.

Depending on who's working you can stand there from anywhere from 10 to 25 minutes ordering one item sometimes. I understand there are online orders and GrubHub but I've been a manager, food server, shift supervisor, dishwasher, I've done it all in restaurants and whenever there is a customer that walks , you never let them stand there and wait for one item ! when you're standing there doing delivery items, noway. you quickly do the item for the customer that's present in the restaurant get them finished paid and out the door then continue your out going orders. And I feel as though every time I come here the opposite happens I walk in order one item and wait 20 minutes.. quality of the smoothies is five stars.

This doctor has left me without medication and not enough time to find a new doctor and get my prescriptions refilled because I came down with COVID. I have been abandoned with no recourse. I will be calling the state to file a complaint and will not drop this. Having to reschedule two to three appointments (appointments were not back to back as I was accused) over the course of two years (with more than twenty four hours notice) is NOT grounds to abandon your patients. I\u2019m still fuming over the male at the front desk who laughed like a hyena when I questioned why I was being dropped. Steer clear of this place.\n\nUPDATE: I followed their link and submitted report. I\u2019ll update here if anything comes from it. Forgot to mention, I was told I missed three appointments in a row by the laughing man on staff. It isn\u2019t true. I missed one because I had been sick and needed labs done before my appointment. I had just seen the doctor and was given new meds at my previous appointment.  I had an appointment already scheduled for September and while I\u2019m waiting on refills, they instead cancel me and remove me as a patient.\n\nLove the doctor but was cancelled  as a patient after calling in to reschedule three (only two with this doctor-one was with previous doctor) appointments (they were not consecutive appointments, and I always called in advance so they could fill the spot) so they have now cancelled my next appointment and refuse to fill my meds. No one notified me. So much for all my family going to one doctor. I now get to move myself, my mom, and my husband to another office. Office manager guy repeatedly  laughed at me when I called to question what happened. As a nurse, his behavior was rude and unprofessional. I loved this doctor and his nurse. It\u2019s a shame I\u2019m punished for doing what I thought was right\u2026.. one cancelled for being extremely sick, one because my son was in ICU, and a third because my mom had surgery and I couldn\u2019t leave her\u2026.

Not only was it fresh, but it was delicious as well.\n\nAlthough I wish this place opened longer, I think they carefully craft each drink to perfection. My drink had strawberries and a tea base which mixed together, tasted like a refresher. I was also pleasantly surprised by the passion fruit fruit tea which tasted like it came straight from the fruit itself. It had a concentrated flavor and a slight tang to it. The peach green tea was delicious as well but you can taste more green tea than actual peach.\n\nThe menu has interesting items and I can\u2019t wait to come back to try the Yuzu Dream. If they had some sort of description on their menu of what was contained in each drink, I feel like it would have appealed more to customers. Other than that, the atmosphere and dining area is comfortable. They also sell cakes and desserts which look heavenly. I hope to come back soon but I recommend this mom & daughter shop!

As we walked in, the first thing grab your attention is the space of the restaurant and also the bar in the center. The design was neat and cool, not my favorite because it's just felt it was dimmer and darker but I guess that is the theme for it. We ordered the special with a nowcrab legs, shrimp head on and green mussels, the order automatically came with corn and potatoes. Also we ordered a pound of king crab, two lobster tails, hard boiled eggs and fried calamari. I did order all the Sauces on the side garlic butter sauce, Cajun and crab du jour which it tasted a little bit salty, also the Sauces came in a big portions which there was a lot of waste plus they were too cold especially they are made with butter.The king crab was good but the it was too pricy for a medium size, I enjoyed the snowcrab legs as well the lobster tails and the green mussels.\nThe calamari were crispy and good but the marinara sauce on the side was cold straight from the fridge which it kind ruined the taste of the calamaries. The corn were flavorless, I believe they were boiled for too long and the same for the hard on shrimp.\nDefinitely going back to try it again in the future and I will see if there is any improvement. The server was kind and friendly she brought us two shirts at the end of our meal and I asked her if I can have hats as well and the manager brought them to us and told us that whenever we come here wearing either the shirt or hat we tend to get 10%off.","pics":[{"url":["https:\/\/lh5.googleusercontent.com\/p\/AF1QipMDQ9Sy4u-WAjPfwghWmnrkyPhyIZ_MQjS4h3HQ=w150-h150-k-no-p"]},{"url":["https:\/\/lh5.googleusercontent.com\/p\/AF1QipOh5qVLTnNa39UeBSLakD1zRDy8FZ5RAwdiod-Q=w150-h150-k-no-p"]},{"url":["https:\/\/lh5.googleusercontent.com\/p\/AF1QipPE3DRTy_nc6iDhSX6_fNQXkClNWK2aCDvdNUx2=w150-h150-k-no-p"]},{"url":["https:\/\/lh5.googleusercontent.com\/p\/AF1QipMvs6QtR2EipMbGs7z7RpTI3Nt40zX4gndwzsqT=w150-h150-k-no-p"]},{"url":["https:\/\/lh5.googleusercontent.com\/p\/AF1QipMYBhNffgbkVDX_gCGCLFJkBz5CnnNq2ddKYJQR=w150-h150-k-no-p"]},{"url":["https:\/\/lh5.googleusercontent.com\/p\/AF1QipPmdsgK79uQ8qOgAv86eJIJ_ADGh097sNW-8Di3=w150-h150-k-no-p"]},{"url":["https:\/\/lh5.googleusercontent.com\/p\/AF1QipM1aSVSCmEiAES5944vFceImOk41VLBIKbA9cL2=w150-h150-k-no-p"]},{"url":["https:\/\/lh5.googleusercontent.com\/p\/AF1QipOHO0jbIXbXuj970kqQ8a-E-SEZdUArE-t0D1Sh=w150-h150-k-no-p"]},{"url":["https:\/\/lh5.googleusercontent.com\/p\/AF1QipMcyudLIgbK23mvbeIldr2D1SbYUg_M96CjGg8Y=w150-h150-k-no-p"]},{"url":["https:\/\/lh5.googleusercontent.com\/p\/AF1QipOA3EKD0RIvX1L9fJIZQWvCoVNq8ktPciIBcugD=w150-h150-k-no-p"]},{"url":["https:\/\/lh5.googleusercontent.com\/p\/AF1QipMbz2XKVfD3nmRa4dizVXOU5fURsN0KE1zxvTIq=w150-h150-k-no-p"]},{"url":["https:\/\/lh5.googleusercontent.com\/p\/AF1QipPR5OtMmSPQSkWO7KPUC6avqcC6y6GyQHgMoc4d=w150-h150-k-no-p"]},{"url":["https:\/\/lh5.googleusercontent.com\/p\/AF1QipOhSNQJEwkLy4Fx_-_clDslCRxtJkp68E0e2BSe=w150-h150-k-no-p"]},{"url":["https:\/\/lh5.googleusercontent.com\/p\/AF1QipM6SKRnqpIBOx47Kv1jPEN_kRbSwQmuqBiudcCX=w150-h150-k-no-p"]},{"url":["https:\/\/lh5.googleusercontent.com\/p\/AF1QipM_D_39k_QeXolAApo4UrdLIJ6Ow59sIurmINh5=w150-h150-k-no-p"]},{"url":["https:\/\/lh5.googleusercontent.com\/p\/AF1QipPPei1XWZf82tbuubk2mQ1masDs1p6lPDZe7TGt=w150-h150-k-no-p"]},{"url":["https:\/\/lh5.googleusercontent.com\/p\/AF1QipO-9bIpb6qLhHCoW8nFKCQw7kqXhiQXkJLKeaGw=w150-h150-k-no-p"]},{"url":["https:\/\/lh5.googleusercontent.com\/p\/AF1QipMFjjOMp9D48CpV6ou3r1Hj1K-BLZxmI4_v_cES=w150-h150-k-no-p"]},{"url":["https:\/\/lh5.googleusercontent.com\/p\/AF1QipOmgRofQSXIbvriEtYYma5it9pJPl_BsTSxZcoC=w150-h150-k-no-p"]},{"url":["https:\/\/lh5.googleusercontent.com\/p\/AF1QipPvsi5j5bFpMyw0OCczhXX1hpnBgERJ37o6FBDh=w150-h150-k-no-p"]},{"url":["https:\/\/lh5.googleusercontent.com\/p\/AF1QipMmHPKAaKaAl9hzLXzCveYh0gnSA0jkgrsyKVhL=w150-h150-k-no-p"]},{"url":["https:\/\/lh5.googleusercontent.com\/p\/AF1QipOY5pIBWhcQpO_VTwWvxYE3f77moWJhsVyx896w=w150-h150-k-no-p"]},{"url":["https:\/\/lh5.googleusercontent.com\/p\/AF1QipO2QbHH5HkCLpEhi108oLoNqpPA_O5dpkUe3II6=w150-h150-k-no-p"]},{"url":["https:\/\/lh5.googleusercontent.com\/p\/AF1QipNk9p1ltbqaBI7QbF0YTxeiQLcTPkdc47icLFsM=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}],"resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x88d9b1f38dff4dff:0x61443de98cd9c88c","anio":2021,"mes":8,"dia":17,"estado":"Florida"},{"user_id":"102968694191540021430","name":"dadas world","time":1630692603225,"rating":5,"text":"My Experience at Crab Du Jour was good..

This site was the worst one. When I walked in there were several Customers standing around and I wasn't sure who was waiting to order and who was waiting for their cookies. I wait about one minute and then while the girl is standing at the register I walked up and said can I put in an order or is someone supposed to go ahead of me? She said you can. That was it. She Clearly wasn't happy to be there. Then once I put my order in and was waiting for my cookies I watched several boxes go out before me really sloppy, covered in frosting, And the customer had to close the Box. They would just call your name and leave the Box on the counter opened. Once I finally got my cookies,  None of them were served warm and they were extremely sloppy. Hopefully once they get in a good groove this place will become a lot better.","pics":[{"url":["https:\/\/lh5.googleusercontent.com\/p\/AF1QipPMII9VD6fnQco8i0dGYpPPTtgxlMH4m7qra6-e=w150-h150-k-no-p"]}],"resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x88e44b5aa1b320fb:0xf169aafe0f050b23","anio":2021,"mes":7,"dia":30,"estado":"Florida"},{"user_id":"117071803917866391171","name":"Bran J.","time":1630162820884,"rating":4,"text":"The times I've been service has been quick.

Personal Banker add death and disability coverage\u2019s for both my wife and myself after we discussed stating that we did not want to have my wife, however after receiving the coupon book, we discovered that the coverage\u2019s after going back to the credit union and having them redo the loan with the correct coverage\u2019s, now we are trying to get loan documents to prove that the 2 previous loans had coverages and Vystars has refused the documents so I can file a appeal on the my disability claim.

She is completely in tune with you the whole way through. She is communicative, informative and interested in truly helping you relax or in my case heal. She used a combination of modalities and really paid attention to my breathing and responses and adapted and\/or adjusted accordingly.

She could be working at any of the highest end hotel spas in the world but we are fortunate to have her here. The price is VERY reasonable for the level of therapist that she is.

Not a single smile or a sign that says we would love for you to give us a try. The second and I think the most important one is that the food was not good at all. A disappointment given the reviews the place has. Veggie scrambled eggs and a Steak Benedict is what we ordered, but unfortunately that could have been done a lot better. Sort of greasy and charred from the griddle is the look that they had. Maybe there a better options on the menu, saw a great croissant breakfast and waffles on a different table. So I guess the point is that if you want a plate that is more on the delicate side, that has a great English muffin toasted just right, with an amazing Hollandaise sauce, maybe it\u2019s better to look for a different place.

We first met them when we started planning to sell our home, about 3 years ago, and Desiree took the time to guide us through the entire process. Her team works so well together, everything went very smoothly and we sold the home within a couple of days. Then it came the time to find our next home, and we trusted Desiree and her team to help us again.  It was a long 2+ years of looking at numerous houses, and Desiree and her team were always very patient with us. It was a combination of a tough market for home buyers and our personal needs that made the search for our house take longer than expected. Desiree coached us the entire time, she is very knowledgeable of the real estate market, and we never felt lost or left behind.

Before I go into detail about the incident I just want to warn anyone thinking if using this company on their own. DO NOT USE THEM believe the star rating and reviews, they are terrible.  So here is my story.\n\nI call the warranty company, they have Superior Electric call me to set up an appointment.   The first appointment goes fine. The tech calls and comes out, diagnosis the problem and has to order the part.  A week or so goes by. I get contacted the part is in. We set up an appointment the tech comes, works on the repair for an hour and can not fix it.  He says he will come back on Friday and finish.  Friday comes, he does not show, I call him, I call the office.  I talk to a miserable man. He says they are running behind they will be there.  He says is real nasty to say the least.  Well they never show. I call the office on Monday, she's nice. But oppps they closed the call, now I have to call the the warranty company to set up another service call.\n\nI do so, the warranty company has to contact superior to call me to set up another call. They do, we set the appointment.  I remind them as I told them each time, that I work nights and won't answer the phone in the AM To verify the appointment.  I tell her we will be there, my wife and I have arranged our schedual for the 4th time so one of us will be there. The appointment day comes.. I check my VM when I wake up at 1:30.  The tech says to call him. No ETA given.  The call goes to VM, I try multiple times. I call the office, no one answers.  At this point I blow my lid and leave angry messages on each the techs phone and office phone.\n\nFinally I get a call back from the office at 4:45, they closed at 5.  I get told I never answered my phone and I never called.  Well I blow up again.  Because this, as you can tell has been going on for over a month and now the are calling me a liar.  The office lady who wasn't so nice this time around, which is kinda expected since I was yelling at her. She tells me they can come out again on Thursday afternoon.  Which is the following week.\n\nWell that day comes, no one shows and no one answers there phone.  I leave the office a few choice messages.\n\nNow I call the warranty company, they can't do anything until the repair company closes the call on their end. I have to wait another week.  I call the warranty company again, the first call taker tells me they have to send out the same service company again. I yell at her, get put on hold, she never picks back up. I call again, the second call taker says she will escalate the call to someone above her to make the decision.  That guy calls me back a couple days later. He is actually helpful and says he will set up another company. A couple days later they call, we set an appointment for the following week.\n\nThe new tech comes out, in the AM not PM, but I'll take it.  He looks at the problem, tells me if anyone had used the oven we would have blown our house up because of what the other tech did.  Well isn't that nice.\n\nSo the new tech gets a part from his van and fixes my oven in about 20 min.\n\nThis took nearly 2 months to repair my oven all because Superior Electric is an incompetent, ignorant and useless company.  DO NOT USE THEM, BELIEVE THE 1.7 STAR RATING.","pics":null,"resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x8834e5648fef1479:0xd2f0850654dc74ef","anio":2021,"mes":7,"dia":7,"estado":"Pennsylvania"},{"user_id":"114839940155107747906","name":"Melissa Schmitt","time":1622855974319,"rating":5,"text":"Barton's staff is amazing!

I have a perfectly good washer\/dryer at home, but once a month I strip all of the beds in the house (comforters, sheets, throw pillows and throw blankets), load them all up in bags and baskets and head down to Main Street Plaza Laundromat.  Back when I first started coming here (in 2015), this location had 1 KING sized machine, 3 QUEEN sized machines and TONS of both the front and top loading machines.  As I previously stated, I only come here to wash my big bedding items so typically I'd only use the King & Queen washers.  About 3 years ago one of the Queens, was taken out of commission, which wasn't a HUGE deal, I just had to break 1 load down into 2 smaller loads and use the front loaders.  Then again around Jan 2021, I took notice that ANOTHER one of the QUEEN MACHINES was out of order.  (I can understand not waiting to replace or fix every single washer when it breaks down, but the KING & QUEEN machines are your bigger money makers, The King costs $5.50 per load and the Queen is 3.50 [I think] a load, so you'd think that they'd eventually get fixed.  Unfortunately I don't think that's going to be the case though.  I do know that the facility is just as clean as any other older laundromat that I've visited, they have a corner mounted tv that usually has some sort of cable show on, and they also have a vending machine with snacks.  During the summer months, the business is comfortably cool and in the winter months its warm and toasty inside.  One positive thing that I do have to add is that in April of this year (2021), the full-sized glass door that you'd enter through became cracked (the crack spidering out all the way from the top to the bottom, and the management replaced\/fixed the door in just a matter of days, which was nice to see.  I hate to publicly post any negative reviews about any local businesses (especially now, when so many of them are struggling to get buy), and if\/when the washers get fixed I will come back revise\/change my rating and review.","pics":null,"resp":null,"gmap_id":"0x89c8f32204e4b7e1:0xdaed3b0566d360b4","anio":2021,"mes":7,"dia":28,"estado":"Pennsylvania"},{"user_id":"108930036568757551561","name":"Mary Einsig","time":1610849934893,"rating":4,"text":"It could have been cleaner, the waste cans were overflowing and 2 washers had dirt in them.

I first want to say that the 3 Joe's did a really nice job plus they were really friendly and professional. Very pleasant guys. If I could rate just them, I\u2019d give 5 stars.  However, I would never have this company do any more work for me. When I first contacted this company, it took 2, or it may have been 3 messages for someone to finally call me back. I understand they may have overlooked my messages but read on and you'll see the same thing happened when I tried to contact them again. The main reason for poor rating is that Gavin the owner or manager, is arrogant. After we got a heavy rain, I noticed that the storm door was leaking. Again, it took 2 phone calls to finally get someone to call me back. Spoke to Gavin and they sent someone back out to caulk which helped a lot but then it rained hard again and it still leaked.  Spoke to Gavin again and he told me that \"doors leak when there is a heavy rain\" and in essence, I just needed to accept it. That is not true, because the last door that I had, never ever leaked, even after years of heavy rain. If the door hadn't been so old and worn looking, I would have kept it. More recently, Gavin came out to give me an estimate on a sunroom. He never got back to me after his visit. He said he would email me pricing details, but never did. When he was here, I found him very irritating. He just has a really arrogant way about him, he was exactly who I thought he was after speaking to him about my door leaking, but his demeanor solidified my impression of him. He just seems like such a phony, like he's the one doing YOU a favor. Really a turn off to his company, especially when he thinks his customers are stupid enough to think that storm doors should still leak during a heavy rain. I had someone come over and caulk a little more and stop the leak. So many better companies in the area who truly appreciate their customers, unlike this guy.","pics":null,"resp":{"time":1610178574641,"text":"Hi Susan, we are extremely disappointed that you felt this way about our company. For 67 years and 4 generations we strive to provide the best service and products at a fair price to all customers.

Storm doors are meant to be weather resistant, they are not \u2018waterproof\u2019, and were following the recommendation of an expert installer.
