I also really love the atmosphere. The booths are intimate, and the bar is also a really nice, relaxed option. The salsa trio is so nice, very fresh. I would come here just for a drink and an appetizer if I want to keep it casual. Enchiladas de pato are lovely. They do seem to change up the menu frequently. I came to the area a few months ago and had an amazing daiquiri, but it wasn't on the menu this time. I asked if they could still make it, and they were able to, but it definitely wasn't the same, so I might stick to their menu offerings next time. They seem to put a lot of care into that. Their Caribbean Old Fashioned is amazing, so balanced and with that perfect sphere of ice. The plantains are amazing as well, and the churros are great if you are hoping for dessert. They are rich, so you can skip and just enjoy the plantains, either way!","date":"2020-01-01 19:27:31","anio":2020,"mes":1,"dia":1},{"review_id":"VR3UxNKqeB38t8UkgKqkHQ","user_id":"oTpWGsQ774RcFLjAnbfvDw","business_id":"VBWUdluhRQf5kqawykM6Nw","stars":3.0,"useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":1,"text":"Very nice staff first.

We were excited to try their newest location in the Scheels shopping center. The ambient is kinda bare, only 2 lonely sombreros hung on top of the entrance and some quiet Vicente Fernandez was playing in the background. We waited to be seated, ordered our drinks and a queso fundido to start off. The drinks we grabbed didn't taste like alcohol, which was a bummer. My sangria just tasted like grape juice, was hoping to at least taste some booze in there. The queso fundido was really good. Just a bowl of melted cheese with pico de Gallo mixed in. Really upped our chips and salsa game. It took longer than expected to get our food, the place wasn't packed until we were almost done with our meal, the service itself wasn't terrible, just slow. \nThe food was mediocre at best. The carnitas I ordered were salty and dry and the adobo chili burrito my boyfriend ordered was not good. He took one bite and didn't bother to eat more. The sauce tasted of nothing but liquid smoke, there wasn't anything else inside the burrito apart from the meat drowned in this liquid smoke sauce. We took it to go, in hopes of mixing the meat with some greens and making a salad and hoping it's edible then. I don't know if it's just this location or if it was just yesterday that they just weren't having a great day, but I don't remember their original location being this mediocre. I'll wait to come back and see if they've improved.","date":"2020-01-01 21:04:00","anio":2020,"mes":1,"dia":1},{"review_id":"Bct89udKo_rWTxRRQx6tZQ","user_id":"gySVAUwvmaGv5z7Ao3OAYQ","business_id":"ugNplY4SZqIfP417oUxahQ","stars":3.0,"useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0,"text":"They would get a solid 5 stars from me if this review was based only on the food and friendliness of the staff, but the way they handle their drive thru is so ineffective, and frustrates me so much, that I have to knock off 2 stars.

I had eaten at a Logan's elsewhere (Florida) so, in spite of all the options available near my hotel, decided to stop in. \n\nThe \"hostess\" confirmed the number in my party (definitely not a difficult task) and pointed me to another stand of menus and what appeared to be guest checks. I stood there, apparently invisible, for at least 5 minutes (more than I would typically wait but I was really tired) while she chatted with servers near the kitchen. By the way, no other staff member made eye contact let alone asked if I had been helped, during the time I remained at my post. By the way, the \"hostess\" was in no way searching for a suitable table as the restaurant was less than half full and I had told her any open table was fine. \n\nOK, now the good stuff...\n\nFrom my great vantage point at the  stand I had been directed to stand, I watched a female server hurriedly leave a booth near the bar area. As she left the couple seated in the booth, she turned and clearly said, \"F __k you b____h,\" to the guests and walked past me to the servers area while dropping a plate to the floor. While I have no idea what started the incident, the guests obviously left immediately. \n\nOddly, I had no interest in staying at Logan's as, from all indications, this operation was a dumpster fire and I left the restaurant. During the time at my assigned station I saw no one who even remotely appeared to be a manager which obviously was no surprise. By the way, I went nearby to Hickory Falls and enjoyed a great dinner, excellent service and was not deserted at a place where I could watch a poorly operated restaurant. Hickory Falls was excellent (see my Yelp review). \n\nI'll leave it to you, my fellow Yelpers, to make your own choices when looking for a place to spend your money.","date":"2020-01-01 15:35:12","anio":2020,"mes":1,"dia":1},{"review_id":"4WFbPrkw4aHVugMUhWtNnA","user_id":"ssc_xh9afTGpbLo8HBRVkg","business_id":"Ibzon-fDLrRUdzvjTcXNvw","stars":5.0,"useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0,"text":"It was pricey, but I'll be back.

(Can't remember), was absolutely amazing.  She had great recommendations and let us know when we order something great.\n\nThe food was absolutely amazing.  I went with my husband and a couple friends.  We tried all the things!! \n\nAppetizers - Brussel sprouts, plantains and wings.  It was all amazing!!  \n\nEmpanadas - so, 3 come in the order.  We thought it only came with one, so we ordered the mushroom, chicken, cheese and chorizo.  All were sooo great!! The mushroom was definitely my favorite though.\n\nMain course-- Paella... it was a little too spicy for me, but still good.  My husband thought it was some of the best scallops he's ever tried.  Canelones - omg, these were my favorite.  Skirt Steak - I don't eat beef, but my husband, who is a meat snob, said it was amazing!  The pole ya that came with it was by far the best polenta I've tried!  We also tried the Cuban Tortas - this was great as well.  The yuca chips that came with it were so light and crispy. \n\nThis is one of the first meals I've had in awhile where EVERYTHING  was great.  I have zero complaints.  Plus their cocktails, churros, and the complimentary fried goodness at the beginning was amazing!  \n\nI cannot wait to go back!  Props to the Cunningham group.

So let's start with the room , checked in a little before 8 pm last night opened the small mini fridge and it smelt like death, days old garbage smh... called front desk , the young lady came up and cleaned it right away , also advised her that the Kleenex box was empty and that the toilet didn't flush (room 219) however my husband fixed the toilet issue, when I called front desk to tell them about no Kleenex and the toilet not flushing however my husband fixed it , she proceeds to tell me to adjust valve in the back. Like really , smh, we had to fix issue or self , so this was strike 1, 2 and 3. My husband and I go enjoy The Row fireworks, came back to room around 1 am , you know happy New Years , went to sleep and during the middle of the night the air conditioner starts making weird noises and room gets really hot, so I did not get a comfortable nights sleep, called front desk at 6 am , and told Miranda to cancel my next nights stay because I was unhappy with all the issues with the room and also told her that I was so unhappy with my stay that I wanted my money back. At first she was gracious, empathetic and said that she would cancel and refund tomorrow night and refund my money. Ok fine conversation should had been over , however then she goes on to say \"why didn't I call her , that she was here all night \" so I told her that I am calling it's 6 am I should be sleep but I can't. She then goes on to blame me for not reaching out sooner , or you kidding me, \"I'm the guest \" they knew that this was a shitty room before they gave it to me and further more as I type this review people are stomping on the floor above. I guess that's my fault too. I was just going let it go because I know that the front desk can't control everything, but Miranda only made bad situation worst by insulting me saying it's my fault which is horrible customer service, well they wil never have to worry about me again as I will never stay at this location again. I feel that I'm owed an apology and I will be reaching out to upper management to get that apology that I'm owed. And also they need blackout curtains I can't sleep because of the light as well.

My friend and her two children joined us for the last two nights. My brother and his kids spent two nights in the hotel as well (in their own room). My nephew wanted to sleep in my room with his cousin one night. My nephew wet the bed in the middle of the night. When I woke up and discovered what had happened, I immediately stripped the bed. There is a mattress protector on the bed, and that was wet as well. I tried to take it off, but it was zip tied on. I called housekeeping around 6am and let them know what had happened and requested that someone come and remove the cover and change the sheets. I reminded the front desk of my request around 1pm, as it had not been taken care of yet. Around 6pm, it still had not been taken care. I called the front desk again and said if someone would just come take the cover off and bring me sheets I would make the bed myself. Someone came up and handed me sheets and then started to leave. I told her I needed the mattress cover removed. She went over to the bed and started to make it. I stopped her and said the mattress protector needed to be taken off. She explained that she didn't speak much English. I tried to explain what was needed, and she said she had to talk to a supervisor. She left. A few minutes later, the front desk calls and says that the mattress protector can only be removed by maintenance, and they won't be in until 6am the next morning. I explain that there is only a zip tie holding it on, and she said only maintenance can remove them. She repeated that they would be in the next morning. I explained to her that there was per on the bed, and we needed to sleep on it. She stated that my only other option was to switch rooms. I'm sorry, what??  You really can't change this sheet, so now I have to move rooms with 3 little kids?  I was told that was my only option. Because we needed the bed, I had to switch rooms. The new room was on a completely different floor. It was a huge inconvenience, and took at least an hour and a half out of the time I was supposed to be spending visiting with my friend. No one offered any help with our move or any other form of compensation for this huge inconvenience. I find it ridiculous that there was no way to remove this mattress cover. I can't be the first person to stay there who has had a child wet the bed. What would they have done if the hotel was full and they couldn't find us a new room?

I will say that our service was as good as it could be given the fact that the kitchen is taking forever!!! Our server checked on us often assuring the food would be out soon. Sadly as we were leaving there was another customer who had also experienced the \"slow service\", which will translate to most as the server was doing a bad job; that's not the case here. It was all the kitchen. My husband heard the owner\/manager (I am not sure if it was the owner or the manager) ask the man who his server was, I really hope that they are assessing the whole issue and not blaming the \"slow service\" on the server. The food was mediocre at best. Portions were decent. The prices are high. I don't mind paying for good food, so we won't be back.  PS the same owner\/manager cut in front of me when I was walking up to pay with my husband and I said \"excuse me\" and he didn't even acknowledge.  Just not a pleasant experience other than our servers who were all very sweet.\n\n***Update to prior review above***\n1\/1\/20 - Date of second visit\nSo we tried again. Last time. Whole pieces of bacon in my omelet, also what appeared to be not well drained frozen spinach and canned tomatoes, again not well drained. Asked for onions in my hash browns but they came with out so my server had me move them to another plate to take back to the kitchen so what was retuned to me was extremely over cooked strings of potatoes dripping in grease with some onions in them. My husband's home fries had onions in them but he didn't order them. He had biscuit and gravy with very little gravy.\nPS - everything written above where I posted the date 1\/1\/20 was a prior visit as I could only edit my review not leave a new one. The information provided below the date 1\/1\/20 is a second experience at this establishment. The owner responded to my updated review and stated that he doubted the same exact thing happened twice. So I want to clarify that this is two different visits the most recent denoted by the date - both less than desirable dining experiences. And the exact same thing did not happen twice. He also assured me that the tomatoes weren't canned, and so to that I say they were old if they weren't canned.","date":"2020-01-01 14:40:54","anio":2020,"mes":1,"dia":1},{"review_id":"zfcNoyeqlGv-UA9C4JSv5g","user_id":"JH0nAhYlf77cpZkqfWOvig","business_id":"Vz2RN55rTJBGn43K1v84nA","stars":2.0,"useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0,"text":"Overall: not a great experience due to long wait, disappointing taste of food; service was okay, and the bread was probably the best thing about this place\n\nPros: bread with hot chili oil was quite tasty.

The vibe on the interior definitely gives you a totally different feel and experience. Call me crazy but an interior flapper gal was evoked, where I felt transported back in time.

I think he thought that he was being food network fancy being that it had a chef's fried egg atop. Mom had no problem with the Valchi and enjoyed selection too.\n\nNow when it comes to that Virgil Starkwell fried chicken, well let's just say the best fried chicken I have tasted in this area thus far.  \nGood size, consistent battered coating with a sensational spice mixture [not spicy] giving it flavor with every bite. Opt to have more fried onions on the side vs fries and my tastebuds were dancing.\n\nTo finish off the meal we opted to share a dessert since we were all pretty full. After a quick review of what they had, figured why not try that Blue Ribbon Key Lime Pie.  I was hoping it would be a citrus palette cleanser. Well I would have to say that it wasn't that or what I expected of a classic traditional key Lime pie. It was more of a Cheesecake like look and feel. It was good, but definitely not enough of that limey explosion that I was hoping for. \n\nAll in all this location is definitely worth the stop in for just about anyone. \nWhether you are a local or a traveler in town like me, swing in and keep Gigglewaters alive!","date":"2020-01-01 16:22:11","anio":2020,"mes":1,"dia":1},{"review_id":"-FhHM5DrLRKD8LaDv6-ltQ","user_id":"0Y8H0rIpLRi47IAuxB6z5A","business_id":"C4alYKA7QUKmP7diWP1M2A","stars":1.0,"useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0,"text":"The place is nice, but it's operation is very poor.

I want more right now so bad. I loved the spread of sauces they had going on, too. You better believe I dipped my bourgeois fries in all nine of them. Hard to decide which sauce reigned supreme; I really enjoyed them all. As for the funguy burger, well, I never would've known it was 70% beef 30% mushroom if I hadn't read it on the sign. Love your life and order the burger with the heat toppings. Lastly, the Boise Fry corporate door - it's like the wardrobe from Narnia for adults.

Before Boise got most of the other major pub \/ brewery chains (10 Barrel, Texas Roadhouse) there was good old Old Chicago. It seemed like we'd make it to the Towne Square location once a month because they had a great Happy Hour (beer deals and mini pizzas, I'm not sure what they have for happy hour deals these days). We've frequented the downtown location over the years as well. \nThis past week we decided to meet friends for lunch at Old Chicago. If you are part of the Old Chicago rewards (email) club you get a birthday reward, so I decided to try using the reward. The reward must be used for a pizza. We decided to go for the \"Veggie 7\" pizza with their thick crust. Overall the pizza was decent. I had imagined a deep dish pizza, and of course it ended up being a thick crust with no more ingredients on top  than a typical pizza. The red sauce was unremarkable as well. I'd rate it overall 3 out of five. The other lunch items looked great; grilled chicken breast sandwich, burger, and lunch personal pizza special. The pizza special looked like a 8\" pizza with a side salad option for about $8. The sandwiches were around $9 with fries, which compared to many sit down restaurants these days is a good price. At the end of the day I settle on a 4 star rating for Old Chicago, but would skip the thick crust option for my pizza and maybe try a white sauce.\nAll the employees we encountered were attentive and efficient. I will be back next year for my Old Chicago Reward visit.","date":"2020-01-01 21:08:25","anio":2020,"mes":1,"dia":1},{"review_id":"t0odQm1v5Jx5sKWX6aQK3g","user_id":"YBOSYZmVFFaN0JdYe37kLQ","business_id":"CYKj959PZDjweV-CSpssCg","stars":5.0,"useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0,"text":"Best un-kept secret in Reno.

My family always comes here to celebrate anything worth celebrating. And this is go-to date not location.\n\nDon't let the parking lot and outside of the casino fool you - they've remodeled everything and it's quite lovely inside.

I prefer filets, however they cut them like a baseball - because they're so thick it's hard to cook them properly. So instead I usually get their ribeye, which is unheard of for me. I HATE the texture of chunks of fat. *shivers* But their ribeyes are perfectly marbled and seasoned! I always get the scalloped taters and usually the soup of the day to go with it.\nI love the two salads they make table side, though I usually go for the Caesar. \nIF I get an appetizer, as the portions are phenomenal for the price, I go for the sampler. So good, and so filling.\nAnd who doesn't like a palate cleanser of sorbet and champagne!??\nI never have room for dessert but will always have a couple of bites of anything. The warm towels and cookies at the end are the best finishing touches to a wonderful evening.\n\nAll in all, stop eating here everyone! It's amazing but you can't have it! I'm putting my foot down.

Several at my table did and they liked it, along with the quantity being a bit better.  \n\nThe birthday cake\/ice cream was fun because of the sparkler, but the cake tasted like it was a day or two old.

Their service is incredibly slow now so I always order in advance but I still wait a long time... today I placed an order for 3 bowls that were to be done by 1:15 and my order wasn't ready until 2:10. When I got home and looked at the bowls, they were completely wrong. They were all made with no honey except for the one that I asked for no honey on. This was extremely disappointing because I'm allergic to honey and the only bowl with honey was mine. The other two bowls were made wrong, too. One of them had no granola, the spinach was not fully blended (there were literal chunks of spinach inside of the base), and there was 4 blueberries and probably the equivalent to 2 bananas . I mean, it was basically just a\u00e7a\u00ed base with chunks of spinach, topped with tons of bananas!!  The other bowl was missing strawberries.\n\nAs I was leaving, the employee at the cash register said, \"do you come here often?\" and then gave me a punch card as a consolation. I assumed he would punch the whole thing since I waited close to an hour, but he said-- \"If you buy 7 more bowls, you can get a free one!\" & then punched my card 3 times.

What a great food way to end 2019 and ring in 2010.\n\nUpon a wonderful greeting to selecting our table to the fabulous service delivered by Sam, she is a jewel at this establishment. \n\nSo glad that Salvatore made a repeat decision to not run Eve of holidays with a special menu, instead he was open to making anything possible in addition to the night's special dishes.  One, in particular, caught my culinary sense-- the octopus special, slivers of octopus in olive oil with a hint of lemon and some pepper.  This dish to me personally was one of the top 2 preparations of Octopus.  Salvatore's creation measured right up at the top against an Italian restaurant I found while traveling on business in Mainz Germany.  I've been holding one to that dish as my comparison and have tried so many since back in NYC, Philly and surrounding Philly\/Princeton burbs, all good, but none came close.  Even my wife who is usually opposed to octopus, cut tentacles tend to have a rubbery taste is not cooked right; she loved the dish and have half.\n\nNext, we enjoyed a Sal's special salad, so light on the dressing that it gave the vegetables a glisten of flavor that sparkled on the tongue.\n\nFor our mains, Sal prepared at my wife's request, clams in a white broth\/sauce with linguine, was outstanding and I had the veal marsala in a brown sauce (just the right amount of thickness) with mushrooms; left nothing over, was that good.\n\nBeing out of room due to enjoying the fabulous baked bread and dipping oil we opt to bring a desert home to ring in 2020... tip, Tartufo (always terrific) does travel well when placed in the rear hatch or trunk (haha.)\n\nSalvatore's has welcomed us and warmed our bellies with a smile and even a hug or two, we are true believers and will even need to try their pizza as well.  \n\nBe sure to see my food photos of our meal.","date":"2020-01-01 17:13:16","anio":2020,"mes":1,"dia":1},{"review_id":"8afg9WYfMUMtTYmgg-SDbA","user_id":"U5xOdeSLGXEVoUa1fSen4g","business_id":"6wqxuBt2InDipRuUj8BNuQ","stars":4.0,"useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0,"text":"There's limited seating and the chairs aren't very comfortable so it may not be the best place to be doing work, but there's a great view of City hall across the street.

Since it was used and sold \"as is\" we asked repeatedly if the car had been inspected (yes), and if the mechanics had found anything structurally or major wrong with the car (no). Unfortunately, we believed them.   I would hope that their mechanics are not so inept that they would be able to spot a bent rear end and two bent rims during an inspection.  Our mechanic found those issues immediately, without being asked to look for them, on top of the issue we originally took it in for:  a scraping noise when the car turned left.  That problem was caused by someone at the dealership over inflating a tire to 80 lbs-almost 3 times the correct amount.  When the pressure was released to the correct amount, there was a huge bulge in the tire.  Again, I'm not sure if that was caused by someone not knowing what they were doing, or if it was an attempt to hide a bad tire\/leaking rim.  Fortunately for us, the tire didn't explode on the 2 hour drive home.  Deliberately allowing a vehicle with serious defects to be sold and driven off the lot, especially knowing it was going to be driven several hours away, is not only deceitful but dangerous and potentially fatal.\n\nNeedless to say, we are not happy with having to pay an additional $2,000+ to fix preexisting damages to the car (so far) that were not disclosed even after many attempts by us to find out the actual condition of the car.  \"As is\" shouldn't exempt a dealership from doing the right thing and disclosing what condition the car is really in so the buyer can make an honest choice.  \n\nWe will definitely never use or recommend this business again.","date":"2020-01-01 22:38:00","anio":2020,"mes":1,"dia":1},{"review_id":"namtRX0zie1J4cLolFaDYg","user_id":"FwFMhL1FMSkh6Mo0hF5jgA","business_id":"NW19d7iBtU_Gwi4ArVDnEw","stars":3.0,"useful":1,"funny":1,"cool":1,"text":"They charge an extra $2.50 for French fries which were old, definitely old.

The view of downtown Nashville from our room was nice - we were on the 8th floor.  Most channels on our TV worked fine.  However, HBO did not work on our TV.\n\nWe made use of the indoor pool during our stay.  The pool was nice and appeared to be well maintained.  A couple of issues I had with the pool area: 1. There weren't any towels. Staff brought towels when they were requested, but were not attentive to restocking them and they were gone the next time we visited the pool.  2. There was a pool cleaning robot in the pool during pool hours.  This should have been put in after the pool was closed for the night and removed in the morning before the pool opened.\n\nThis hotel is conveniently located to most of the popular downtown venues.  We ordered in pizza for dinner from Castrillo's Pizza.  It was pretty good; I'd recommend it.\n\nOverall, our stay at this Hyatt Place was enjoyable and I'd recommend it to everyone.","date":"2020-01-01 18:14:04","anio":2020,"mes":1,"dia":1},{"review_id":"e56CueAq9oVk7hPhtsKAEw","user_id":"sWE-CGykeuGjfc5MaM3_Rw","business_id":"fE8Vyo9HwsQIE9z3KuoWUw","stars":2.0,"useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0,"text":"Typically love this place but tonight was not their night.

So, if you think its tacky of me, or in poor taste, keep it moving\u200d At this point I feel I absolutely MUST. I want to warn every single person I know about my experience with Ashley Furniture. I had purchased an item online, and it was delivered on the 17th of December, decided I did not want this item, called the very next day which was within their 72 hour window of returns. Was on hold for an hour, told someone would contact me within 48 hours, no one did. I called back the next day, was on hold for 45 minutes, told a pickup was never arranged, and that she would have someone contact me within 48 hours to arrange pickup, and that she would personally follow up with me to make sure that this actually happened. NEITHER of those things happened. I have had constant emailing back and forth up until today, with each person I talked to telling me they would arrange pickup, and NONE of them ever arranged this. I call this morning, was on hold for an hour, pawned off to 4 different people, 2 of which told me they were so sorry, and that sometimes management doesn't like to take returns back and will delay the process, THAT CAME FROM THEIR OWN EMPLOYEES MOUTHS!! That the online store, the physical local stores, the company that arranges pickup, as well as the company that actually picks up returns, are all independent, and not affiliated with one another so all of their hands are tied..Also, I might add that the local store here off of Fairview and Eagle Road DOESNT EVEN HAVE A PHONE NUMBER!! YOU CANT EVEN CALL THEM... Its just the basic 1-800 number for all stores. SHADY. I finally get connected to a 5th person, a supervisor, only to then be told that I am past the 72 hours window and they will not be accepting my item back for a return. At this point, im so incredibly frustrated, I actually have NO WORDS. After hanging up the phone, and looking into this, I found tons of online reviews with the same issues, and well as several law suits, and scathing YouTube reviews of the very same issue. SO, if this can save even just one person this incredible amount of frustration, then COOL, THATS SUUUUUUUUUPER DUPER.

With that being said, I have to admit I was pleasantly shocked by Gus's. I did not expect to enjoy it as much as I did. I ordered the 3 piece dark with fried okra and fries. \n\nObviously the most important part of this review is the fried chicken, but I cant start without complimenting the fried okra. At the first bite of okra, there was this explosion of deliciousness in my mouth that brought back memories of my first taste of fried okra during a hot Georgia summer when I was in elementary school. I gotta say, its not often that food illicits such a strong emotion in me (okay I lie, I am very passionate about food and get quite emotional when eating something delicious, and thats exactly what happened with this okra). \n\nThe fried chicken was of course great, but I cant say it wasn't without its flaws. It was fried evenly throughout, crispy where it needed to be, juicy in the center, and overall extremely satisfying, however I was a little bit thrown off by the spice distribution on the chicken, There were certain bites of chicken that seemed to be more flavored than other parts. Luckily each part of the chicken was still delicious, however the uneven flavor distribution did take away from the experience a bit. \n\nThe fries were pretty average, nothing spectacular but a good compliment to the chicken. \n\nOverall a great fried chicken spot in STL, would definitely recommend to friends, and will be returning!!!","date":"2020-01-01 02:16:54","anio":2020,"mes":1,"dia":1},{"review_id":"u_FSOI3yYiIwhyWIz4-nCA","user_id":"2yAozBtoQuWjsSOG19XzBQ","business_id":"-tRhEoFo5viTTPX316ut6w","stars":2.0,"useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0,"text":"This Plase Is Super Slow .

However, my review is honest and not biased, except for me being an old, grumpy man. \n\nNormally, the prices at the Ritz are ridiculous and I'm perfectly happy with a Renaissance or even a Courtyard room, but I said \"what they hey, it's Christmas\" and decided to blow some points. When I usually go to Marriotts, I get upgraded and given free crap, but not here. It was an additional $100 per night for a club level room. If I wanted to get sloppy drunk by noon, this would've been worth it, but that wasn't the whole goal of being in NOLA during this trip. I actually wanted to see some sights this time. I declined the upgrade option and got my city-view room. \n\nThe room is nice and comes with plenty of expensive details. Don't break anything! I was pretty happy when I went to bed that first night. Around 3am Saturday morning was when things started to take a turn for the worse. It's New Orleans y'all and the Ritz has drunk people too. I was woken up by some drunk basics coming home and wanting to take \"running and jumping\" selfies for their Insta in the hallway. It didn't last long and I went back to sleep, but that wasn't the end of the noise. The next day I realized how loud people really are or how much noise can come from the hallway because there were kids playing in the hallway for seemed like days. The parents should be beaten.

I'll be back soon.","date":"2020-01-01 19:18:44","anio":2020,"mes":1,"dia":1},{"review_id":"i7tVOCzlkyLshVFhvZ409g","user_id":"Gv-EIq5zG6Q0y4r4HYUE3Q","business_id":"vhbTu2x_1MK6pLRInyBA_A","stars":4.0,"useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":1,"text":"I used to frequent the Dutch Goose a lot when I first moved back to Boise a decade ago and am glad I rekindled my old flame! Not only do they still have 2 for 1 burgers on Tuesdays, a pitcher of Odell IPA is $12, they semi recently spruced the place up, kids are welcome, and there are games!! It's a great spot if you're looking to satisfy your grease tooth in a chill atmosphere for a reasonable price. They had a lot of football on too, if you're into that!","date":"2020-01-01 09:19:38","anio":2020,"mes":1,"dia":1}]
