Hard to say much about the food - after all it is McDonald's. 

It's a matter of recognizing the team. Having gone occasionally over the last year I observe they must be doing something very right. Same staff and same great attitude.

No manager showed herself till the incident was over. I called the police as I was being threatened. The out of control young adults  robbed my iPhone and ran out mocking and celebrating.

I know I shouldn't be eating fast food in the first place, but sometimes you need a little Mickey D's fix.

Let's talk about the McGriddles... I have come to LOVE these!!! And when I haven't had them for a while, I'm gonna be excited to get them. But, to my chagrin the bread - the best part - was stale and hard as a rock on one of them. And both WERE NOT EVEN HOT !!!!!!

I don't  want to hear some fast food employees nonsense about why he cant serve a cheeseburger four minutes early. Your employees would rather argue with a customer at the drive-thru than actually help them tells me all I need to know. This explains exactly why these people are working fast food and will continue to do so. This McDonald's was practically empty and instead of helping me, the people you hired would rather argue. I don't want to argue. I just wanted a quarterbpounder five minutes early. I don't want to listen to a litany of why a hamburger place can't make me a hamburger, all I know i s that you are for denying me service. I don't care what McDonald's policies are about breakfast.

I was just there at 12:30, in other words, peak lunch time. This place always perverts the concept of ""fast food."" The line of cars snaked totally around the building as usual, so I went inside. They had one register open and the girl stationed there pretty much hung out in the back and only came out when she felt like it to wait on one person at a time, only to leave again for a few minutes. The floors were filthy, the trashcan behind the order counter overflowing onto the floor. Two out of three times that I come here, I'm told ""Our shake machine be down."" Today was no exception, and this has happened for the last five years. I even filed a report on this with McDonalds and the manager wrote back to say I was mistaken about the frequency of breakdown of the shake machine.  Today I said that this has happened the last three times I've been there, I asked why the shake machine was always down. Miss Motivated looked at me like I was stupid and I didn't think she was even going to answer me. After about five seconds, she said ""I don't know."" Probably the truth, to be fair. I guess they think I'm just trying to torment them. It's probably an act of God, I certainly don't need the calories. But I think if they routinely can't serve something that shows on the menu, they should probably take it off the menu. The bottom line here is: nobody cares. Certainly not the employees, not the manager, and not even corporate McDonald's. It's  certainly not what you expect from this brand. And I mean that not in a good way.
UPDATE: One week after my review. 9/1/16, ""Our shake machine is down at the moment.""  At the moment, right.
UPDATE. Two weeks after my review. It is 9/8/16. The shake machine is down. When I was there on 9/1 and pushed back a bit, they said, ""it's going to be fixed later in the week."" Since that was a Thursday, I wondered what later in the week actually meant. Probably later in the month.",2017-03-02

Only restaurant near me that is open for 24 hours so I had no other options. Left hungry, and disappointed as the drive-thru that should be OPEN was UNMANNED. NO ONE was at the drive-thru, and I cycled around THREE TIMES and stayed for about 5-10 minutes. I wasn't even the ONLY CAR. There was another car driving as well, who could also not complete their order as no one was even at the drive-thru! It was late, so honking would have been inappropriate, and it was a drive-thru, so we shouldn't feel obliged to have to go inside the store to notify someone that we want to order.  I know the standards at this particular McDonalds aren't necessarily high, but if you accept workers that do not even have the ability to serve their customers, then you as a store have hit a new low. NOT EVEN BEING SERVED. If these lazy workers do not even get punished at all, I'd be extremely disappointed in the discipline system. It's a basic requirement to DO YOUR JOB.

This place is terrible. The food rarely tastes fresh, the service is awful. So often the employees are short and brash with the customers, as opposed to warm and accommodating. They close down the dining room before it's supposed to be. They refuse their customers regular menu items. Most of the times I've been here they've said that the shake machine is ""down"" or ""broken"", probably because someone already cleaned it and they don't feel like doing it again. Tonight, however, they at least had the decency to not lie to my girlfriend and I, and simply said that they ""weren't doing milkshakes tonight""....

I've gone in with my crew numerous times, each time ordering a half-dozen Quarter-Ponder burgers and getting another half-dozen free, using the codes from the surveys and never had a problem, until last night.
We ordered apple pies and the clerk said she didn't have any made, but if we waited 8 min, she'd make us fresh ones. Great! Lashonda then inserted herself as we ordered. I ordered two strawberry creme pies, thinking they would be good to snack on while on duty, around midnight or 1am. Lashonda said they had just one. I asked if she could put some fresh ones in and was told no. I told her I wanted two and she said she ""ain't putting any new ones in. I can have the one that's made.""
Then she commented and kept insisting we go to the McD's on 25th Street.
Okay. That's fine. She kept insisting we go to the other one, so we shall.
We'll let the other shifts as well as the other officers know we need to go to that one.",2018-04-08

She said ""We cleanin' up right now, we cant do that"" (Lequesha), 

We said okay and countued to order two large Mocha Frape's because she could make those at the moment. 

Since we werent able to get what we wanted I ask if we could  get something for free? 

she repliled with ""Nope"" With much more attuide than show in this text. 

I then asked for her name and she replied with ""Lequesha"" 

When i didnt respond after asking for her name she then said ""Why are you gonna ask the person at the next window for somthing free?"" and I said No just so I know who to not to ask for free food next time. 

She had my girlfriends credit card at this point and said, ""Well now your getting two small Frapes"" 

Which was not what we ordered and was very rude and out of line. I have a problen with being treated this way and was on a time contrant and did not have time to ask for the manager at the Mcdolands in Valley Park Missouri.

Today was no exception, and this has happened for the last five years. I even filed a report on this with McDonalds and the manager wrote back to say I was mistaken about the frequency of breakdown of the shake machine.  Today I said that this has happened the last three times I've been there, I asked why the shake machine was always down. Miss Motivated looked at me like I was stupid and I didn't think she was even going to answer me. After about five seconds, she said ""I don't know."" Probably the truth, to be fair. I guess they think I'm just trying to torment them. It's probably an act of God, I certainly don't need the calories. But I think if they routinely can't serve something that shows on the menu, they should probably take it off the menu. The bottom line here is: nobody cares. Certainly not the employees, not the manager, and not even corporate McDonald's. It's  certainly not what you expect from this brand. And I mean that not in a good way.

They've even closed off the second drive-through lane, but they did it by putting milk pallets right where the speaker is where you talk. This means you can't see them until you drive into the lane around the curve and run into the mill pallets. Then you have to back all the way out of that lane and get in the other lane.

I also feel guilty about the unfortunate folks at the door and that I'm eating basically unhealthy food (feeding my processed food addiction) near people who want money to feed their addictions too. There is a sad irony about the human condition that screams in mind when I go there. My processed food addiction, their various addictions, the desperation, OMG if you can overcome all of that, and hang back with the staff near the register, it's not a bad experience :)

So the staff are really nice and patient.

That said, I didn't have a problem with the staff. They seemed friendly enough, maybe only slightly irritated and stressed over something - something I assume is creating the delay. I can't be sure. I'm also not too upset since I wasn't actually in a hurry. Only flabberghasted at how long I really spent there.

So now I am going to the bank to withdraw more 20's, then go somewhere to break a 20 to make that happen. McDonald's, I just want to say you really crapped up my day just because you wanted that one dollar. And I will never be back to the Hatboro McDonald's! And my yelp review is ONE star! -----

Long story short, I asked for the manager to point it out on the menu to the order taker, and she said, ""Oh, you want a regular coffee?""  Then, why the heck have been paying MORE for an Americana when I was lucky enough to get one?  Tonight, what should have been a 3-hr drive home turned into 9 hours. Awful. Everything went wrong. Decided to go through the drive-thru for 3 small burgers and 2 drinks. I waited 15 min, watched someone else's order  scroll up and down ""my"" screen, and I finally said, ""I'm just driving to the window.""  When I got there I  told the girl I knew they were having a tough night, but I just wanted  3 $1 burgers and 2 lg cokes. The manager (I assume) came over and yelled at me to get out of line and drive back around because she was too busy to fool with me. I said, ""No, I've been through the line. I just want my order.""

- waited, the car in front of us pulled to pick up window and picked up
-my daughter was driving and asked ""should I pull up to pickup or not?""  I said no and I yelled through window, paraphrasing ""is anyone there?""
-someone finally showed, took payment but made some sort of comment about how my pregnant daughter ""grabbed"" her charge.
-at the pickup window I asked to speak to the manager, and could hear a response from behind the pickup window attendant, paraphrasing again, ""...I have nothing more to say to them....."". THAT WAS THE MANGER who made the comment at the previous window.

My standards are simple, get me what I ordered, have it be above room temperature, and hand me my bag instead of throwing it...  And because i understand things happen, I expect my standards to be met at 90% of the time. This McDonald's? 50% of the time I get the wrong order, food that tastes like it's been cooked last week, and you guys took away habanero ranch, which I take as a personal insult. Not 5 minutes ago i went to get my meal, i have 15 minutes to run off base, get what i need and get back. All i asked for was 2 mcdoubles, a mcchicken, large fry, and a sweet tea... I know, this is probably stress eating, not at all healthy, and i am working on it. I appreciate the concern. I had my order read back twice. Once at the menu, and once as I paid for it. Just two cars in front of me and one behind, so I think it's safe to assume they're not very busy... youngblood comes to the window with a bag and asks, 10 piece and a big mac? I say no, I have the mcchicken, 2 mcdoubles, fry, and sweet tea. He picks up the second bag, opens it, looks inside and repeats what I just told him. At this point I thought he was telling me what he was looking at, so I (and I'm quite embarrassed about this) trusted the kid. Took the bag and went back to work. I open it to find 2 mcchickens and a medium fry. And this is at least the 6th time this happened.

We heard the shift manager yelling at her people about a breakfast order.  There were numerous problems and all pointed to the fact that the shift manager lost control of her people and the situation. 

At 11:34am, one lady approached the counter and asked for a shift leader.  She pointed out to the shift lead that she placed her order at 10:54am and still did not have her food.

We ended up waiting until about 11:42 to receive our food, which is about 25 minutes after we placed the order.  While our order was correct, we still waited a ridiculous amount of time.

I asked if someone was there and got attitude when I mentioned I waited and saw/heard 4 vehicles on the other side do their order and not even get mine.

Management here really should get it in gear. Not only is the wait to order excruciatingly long, but the wait for food is long as well. The saving grace here is the food, which for me, has almost always been prepared as requested and fries are typically served hot.

I don't understand how hard it can be to ask a customer if they want their order for here or to go. I actually lead my order by saying that my order will be for here. Nope, rung up as to go. I mention this as my food is being bagged and I'm ignored. I take my bag to the table and come back and nicely ask for a tray. In return, I'm asked, ""oh, you want a tray?"" Yes please. Thanks.

Also, since when is it acceptable for employees to check their phone for messages in between taking orders? 

And don't even ask about the restrooms, while I believe they are kept clean, it seems the restaurant may have been remodeled at least 3 times since the last time they considered updating the bathrooms. They're dank and smelly and look like they're from the 1980's at the latest.

The inside of the building was closed, so we proceeded through the drive-thru. There were about 6 cars ahead of us. We didn't move for 20 minutes. AT MC DONALDS. IN TUCSON. LIKE WHAT?

 As soon as we got to the kiosk, there were two lines to choose from. Line 1 and Line 2, we went to line two, furthest from the building and waited for the person on the headset to take our order. We hear a girl say, with a deep sigh, ""Welcome to McDonalds, so umm just to let you guys know we only are accepting cash"" ... Weird flex, but ok. Seems like this location only takes cash? Which to me is a little weird... But thank goodness we had cash on us! After we told her that'd be fine, she came back over the intercom abruptly saying,  ""it's going to be about a 20 - 30 minute wait"", then clicked. There was no where for us to say ""OK"" or ""Thank you not to worry"". There was no where for us to go even if we didn't want to wait. You can't just bail when you're stuck in the line with cars in front and behind you... 

We waited about 3 minutes for her to come back to us to get our order in, we looked over to the other line, line 1, and a man's voice comes over the speaker to the next car, ""Hi Welcome to McDonalds... only accepting cash.."" ""okay cool"" ""What can I get started for you?"" Hearing this THEN, seeing two cars go ahead of me through line 1, AFTER WAITING 15 MINUTES, I said ""Excuse me, m'am?? M'AM?? Can anyone hear me back there?"" She came back on the intercom all frantic ""I SAID IT'S GOING TO BE 20 MINUTES"" 

Having a child yell at a patron, I asked for her to get her manager to please explain why people that were behind me are now ahead of me.

The employee (female) told me that she doesn't have to get her manager and she is refusing me service.

That's fine sweetie. I didn't even want McDonald's but everyone else in the car did. 

The reason this place was so backed up was because she hadn't put the orders in and waited and waited. It's her own fault she was so frantic and behind in the first place. I have worked in the food industry to get a good grasp on how the ship is running. The way these employees and management handle situations are piss poor. 

Sadly, this isn't the first time it's happened to me at this location. The franchise owner is a disgrace to the golden arch. My friends have been yelled at here for the SAME EXACT SITUATION that happened to me. My friends have been yelled at because they went back up to the POS system and told them all the food was cold. The employee told them to eat their food faster, that it wasn't their fault.  Not to mention the food actually sucks. Sadly, when it's the only one that's open on your way home and you have cranky people in the car, you just got to give.

I've never been one to review fast food, but it's actually amazing how bad every visit has been to this place.

Hash browns burnt, missing or cold fries, no salt. I've had Big Macs out of stack order and a complete mess, and ordered a chocolate shake but received vanilla. Drive thru takes at least 15-20 mins on a slow day (don't bother during lunch). Not only that, but rude service every time.

I told her I am only filling it up with water, not anything else. She still yelled at me, ultimately making me feel unsafe and unwelcome. 

If people have been coming in and filling up cups with non-water beverages without paying, this still doesn't give an employee the right to yell at anyone. The McDonald's have the right to tell this person to pay, still please say it instead of spraying it to a potential customer's face.

He did not say welcome to McDonald's or anything except for what do you want to eat. And the other thing is that fast food is literally in the name and I think this place took the fast out of food.,2018-12-13

I feel bad for the employees working here as most of them really do try hard, but this location is so understaffed. There are three registers at the front to take orders, but I have never seen more than one manned regardless of how long the line gets (it's also worth noting this location still does not have automated order kiosks, so your only option is a register). Even then that lone register is empty the majority of the time, as the one front counter employee is busy putting together the last order received. My last few wait times: 14min for a medium fries, 16min for McNuggets, 18min for a McDouble and small fries, 26min (!) for a sundae. Not good, especially as the number of people ahead of me ranged from 0-4 for these orders. The understaffed and rushed nature also leads to the people in the back making mistakes and the food not being right/good quite often. The drive-thru isn't much better as the order is typically slow to come out so they'll tell you to pull forward to wait, despite there not being an actual spot to do so. What results is trying to awkwardly position your vehicle so as not to block any people trying to exit behind you, while still trying to leave yourself a way to backup and leave should there still be a vehicle behind you at the window. Lastly, this location is a major hangout for street people and like it or not, that brings many issues. People aggressively panhandling in the store, obviously intoxicated people ranting at customers and sometimes threatening them, people dealing and/or doing drugs (avoid the bathrooms), etc. It gets especially bad late at night. Most 24hr locations close the inside part late at night and just run the drive-thru in order to avoid such issues, but this location has brilliantly decided to do the opposite and closes the drive-thru at night forcing you to run the gauntlet of sketchiness if you want anything. The staff completely ignore these people and any issues they might be causing, although I can't say I blame them given the circumstances. I worry about the safety of some of these kids working the front counter alone late at night.",2019-01-26

I have been going to this McDonald's for years and am pretty much ready to move on.   

Unfortunately, the proximity to the Goodwill shelter is killing this place.  This McDonald's seems to double as a homeless shelter.  They cling to the place like ants to a dropped french fry.  Homeless are all over the outside of the McDonald's either milling about, smoking around the doors and sometimes pan handling.  Bicycles usually ring the building when the homeless are there to either eat, use the bathroom or do their business with each other outside. Too often the homeless will go into the trashcans outside, grab cups and walk into this McDonald's and refill them at the soda machine, without being stopped by the over taxed staff. 

Inside the place is filthy too often, the managers are always working too hard to fill in to get the orders made as it seems they can't keep a full staff here.  The lobby is also usually has plenty of homeless folks sitting in booths with their bags of possessions waiting for their phones to charge. 

All too often, any amount of traffic causes things to back up and patrons have to stand around the front counter waiting for their orders. 

I have been going to McDonald's for many years.  The quality of the food has steadily been dropping for a long time.  The added hassle of constantly having to wait for food when things are relatively calm and to have to deal with the assorted homeless people every day just makes it not worth the trouble anymore.

I have had to use this for my Mac D's fix. But do to how utterly crappy the service is I have had to give up on McDonalds. Well then I had to go and get some food. And again the service just flat out sucked. I get there at 9:35 am. I waited and placed my order in the drive through. They took my order at 9:39. I paid and then was instructed to pull forward and wait. In this course I watch numerous cars pull off with their food. I was told I was waiting on a Egg White Delight. So now after a wait a young lady walks up and try's to shove into my car a small bag. I looked at her and asked is that my five items?  Of course she said yes! Yes! And I kept saying no. No! There could not be five things in that bag. So with a huff and puff the spoiled ass millennial scampers off to check the car behind me. Then the manager walked out walked around for a few min. Only to walk back in. No. Hey this car has been sitting for ten minutes what's going on?  So after another 5 min I decided enough is enough and just as I was exiting the car they manager showed up with the bag. Now logic would tell me to check the bag. But I figured. Nah it's been ten min I'm sure they got my order right. HELL NO IT WASNT RIGHT!  The damn lazy arses didn't check the order and shorted me. When I got to my work I attempted to call. I was placed on hold for 15 min!  I finally hung the phone up. Shame on me for knowing this Mc Donald's crap and still go. So if you read this take my warning. It's crap. Your going to wait and wait. The food will be screwed up. Why? Oooh I don't know. Maybe they are waiting for the 15 dollar an hour raise. But I'm sure even at 15 an hour this store will still know how to screw it all up. Don't go here. Go across the street. Don't waste your time here for breakfast lunch or dinner. Don't go. People at this store just don't give a damn. The workers are there to just collect a check and be off. Go across the street to Hardee's. It's faster and they won't screw up the order as bad. As far as this store avoid it like the plague. The bathrooms smell and are dirty. The restaurant area is trashed and soda machine covered in syrup. The workers are rude. The manger couldn't run a sack in sack race. Google that if you don't know what a sack race is. So in conclusion don't go here. And if you do just watch out. Thanks and I hope this helps.,2019-02-22

I did a mobile order. Sat in spot 2 for 20 minutes before calling. First person couldn't hear me and without saying anything handed the phone over to someone else. They kept yelling into the phone that couldn't hear me but eventually they understood what I was saying and with an attitude said my food would be out soon. My food was out 5 minutes later. They brought an unsweet tea when I ordered sweet. She went back in and came back out with new drink. I took a sip, again unsweet but with no ice this time. So I had to get my very pregnant self and my toddler out to go in and refill my drink once again, took a sip, tea tasted awful so I refilled with coke. Got home finally after almost an hour and take out my burger, a cheeseburger with no cheese.

We moved up all the way to the front window since our order had to be specially made. After waiting awhile, the food arrived. We got home and were sorely disappointed. My daughter's chicken strips were hard as a rock. It was like chicken jerky, she could hardly chew it. And our sandwiches were like cheeseburgers, but with a higher price tag.

That's right - McDonald's wasn't able to serve burgers because someone made the choice to clean all the grills at once while they were open.

You can expect when they do take your order that they'll get it wrong the first time because they aren't listening at all. They'll never ask if you want anything else. When they're done they ignore the next person in line and dissappear back into the grouped up gaggle of uselessness clustered by the drive through.

The floors and tables are always dirty, and much more than you would expect. There are wrappers, drink lids, discarded napkins, bits of paper, and liquids all over the floor and table surfaces. When they ""clean"" they just sweep the big bits and walk away, ignoring the rest of it. Trays pile up on the garbages, the straws dont get refilled, the napkins can be found empty at times.

I drive through every morning at around 8:42 and I am out by 8:44:50. My very first morning I was just shocked at how quick they were, there was no drive through line and I got my $3.45 bag handed to me so quickly that it almost was like I never even got off the main road.   But then I got to work. And I opened my breakfast. Well, now it was my breakfast. It must have began as someone else's pick?
The first day I essentially got chocolate milk when I took a sip of my ""small coffee with 1/2 and 1/2 and 1 Splenda."" Yesterday I got no sausages in my burrito, so I allowed myself to have dessert! This morning, I was able to learn that I like black coffee (I think my half & half order was taken to mean black coffee mixture?) But anyways, it's the unknown that I crave. Shishito peppers on the menu? I'm in every.single.time. Remember those candy Airheads? I'll buy the white ones. White shark bites? You're not sharing my pack. The 90's puppy surprise, where OH MY I can't believe my eyes! I got 5 puppies inside! (You bet I did.) The unknown is a HIGH.

And what do I love more than a mystery? I'll solve that one for ya: It's BREAKFAST. I love breakfast (all types). And I don't love waiting in lines. I also like friendly people. So all in all, what more can I ask for? I've found myself a trick-or-treat-esque daily morning high where I can buy WHATEVER I want, excuse me, whatever I *get*, simply by digging through my change stash & performing one simple *POP* of my arm out the window. (Pro tip: leave arm extended out the window between checkpoints A (pay) and B (collect food) for ultimate efficiency).

*Sigh of morning happiness* I just feel like it can't go wrong. Everyday is a new, and the very worst is that one day I am given the opportunity to try a McGriddle.",2018-02-28

I mean why did you spend all that money to renovate this (now very nice LOOKING) store if you don't care about what your customers think of it? Presently (10/2018) this location is also infested with both fruit flies and regular house flies. When I went to grab my empty fries box to throw away... a small swarm of fruit flies swarmed out!!  Apparently they were after the leftover ketchup in there. There are also employees who treat EVERY counter order as a ""to go"" order and consequently... I'm left with a unneeded sack to throw away and no tray to spread-out my meal on. Also.. from the company's point of view, this SHOULD be a concern because I'm pretty sure that a sack costs more than a tray liner does. Speaking of money wasting... there hasn't been any ketchup in the spigot/dispenser nor any little paper cups for holding the ketchup for quite some time. Now I KNOW that 4-6 packets of ketchup costs a heck of a lot more than one of those little mini paper cups and 3-4 pumps of bulk ketchup does!! If for no other reason than making more money, the franchisee/owner/company SHOULD give a damn about better serving their customers better so that they actually want to return.

Previously, we haven't encountered any issues with the preparation of our food.
My mother ordered the number 9 {2 cheeseburgers meal with no cheese, with ketchup and pickle only because she is allergic to cheese and they don't offer a 2 hamburger meal}.  When they served us our food there was cheese on both sandwiches.   My mom politely asked if they could be remade due to her allergy. They reluctantly  obliged and were shown the receipt to prove they were ordered without cheese. 
When she got the new burgers, she opened the bun to add extra ketchup and was very shocked by the placement of the pickles. There was a phallic object  (penis) made with the pickles two normal pickles and one long pickle in the center.   This very inappropriate, rude and beyond offensive.

She gave me the price, and as I began to hand her my money, she walked back to the window. There I stood, cash in hand, the cash register flashing away, and nobody to complete the order. Frustrated, I looked around to see another person in line behind me, just shaking his head, another waiting for his order, who was waiting when I came in, and not a staff member to help. I finally gave up, pocketed my money, and went down the street for a nice, relaxed breakfast.",2017-08-04

It was crammed in one medium bag. 20 pc nuggets, two cheeseburgers no o/p/m, a double cheeseburger same way large fries and hot cakes. 

""Is it all in here really?"" ""Yup"" Not trusting this I pull into the mobile order spot and check. Hotcakes are missing. I go inside and am met with amused laughter.

My husband and I had driven out to return some Redbox videos and decided to pick up a bite to eat while out - we saw two fast food restaurants open - the Steak n Shake in Nora (the line was extremely long and generally not that ""fast"") and the McDonald's in Carmel. I have not eaten McDonald's in about 14 months  since committing to eating healthy and losing weight. I have to admit prior to making that commitment ""junk"" food was a weakness. I used the Mc D's app on a regular basis taking advantage of their deals. My app was long since removed but since we decided to grab something, I loaded it back on and found I had a free McCafe. We went through the drive through and after about 10 minutes parked in front of the ordering sign/spot I was finally asked for my order. I told the lady I had a free McCafe from my app I wanted to redeem (we had already looked for the details on the app regarding restrictions but none were given). I asked for an iced Carmel Macchiato - she asked what size? I said well I'm not sure, the app does not specify, she asked ""well what size would you like?"" I responded a Large. We placed our order including 4 chicken tenders & a McDouble. As we started to finally move from the order box - a car comes from the right and cuts in front of us (there was plenty of room since we had been waiting 10 minutes). We figured out their order must have been messed up and they cut in line trying to get it resolved (they were later instructed to pull up to the pick up spot & we saw no money given so likely their order was messed up). We pulled up to the second window (no one was working the first) we were given my coffee & I immediately took a drink and the bag of food. I showed the girl my phone to scan the app and she took it from me with a confused look - she said we can't take any coupons...I said what do you mean? She said we don't have any way to take a coupon. I said well I told the girl at the order station I had a free drink - the only reason I ordered it - the girl looked bewildered - I said I was not going to pay for it as I had a coupon and I had already taken a drink they would have to throw it away anyway. After a minute or so of hiding on to my phone with a confused look - with the sliding window closed, the male manager came to the window and he quite rudely & aggressively opened the window saying they had no way to scan the coupon (we really did not know what he meant as he was making no sense and was not able to articulate clearly). I had given the drink back already but was upset and questioning why they would have taken my order in the first place as I stated I was using a free drink coupon from the app and since they had to throw it away (I took a drink!) wouldn't they rather give it to me than just throw it away? He kept saying there was no way to take it off???   In the end after the manager totally had a melt down using Christmas as the primary excuse and that everyone just wanted to be home with their families (the most inappropriate behavior I have ever witnessed at a restaurant my entire life) he gave us back the credit card and said to just leave. He was actually leaning out the window and very aggressive. We were shocked - as we drove off I discovered we had the food bag - I thought we had given that back too - the whole exchange was so upsetting I didn't realize we even had it! My husband checked to see if the cc was charged - and if so if the drink was included in the charge (since they kept the drink) --- there was no charge. I have many, many years of retail experience. I have many many years of experience as a customer - and many, many experiences at McDonald's over the years. That manager absolutely had the capacity to override the register in some way to give me a drink that I ordered ONLY because I had a free coupon! He should not be a manager and should not have used the excuse that it was Christmas for the poor service and for his very unprofessional behavior. I plan to go to this McDonalds one more time to go inside and speak with the manager (hopefully not the guy working on Christmas) and then make the decision as the whether we will ever patronize that particular McDonald's again.",2019-12-27

This is not a new product. They ALWAYS come with Caeser dressing and croutons. That's what makes it a Caeser salad. Why must I always insist on that when I order? Because if I don't specify, i don't know what I will get. 

With this location however, not only must you specify that you want Caeser dressing and croutons in your Caeser salad, you MUST check your order before leaving. If you don't, something will be missing. Once they even forgot to give me the burger for my combo, and I didn't notice until I got home. 

Today's experience: I order a quarter pounder combo with Caeser salad. I specify that I need Caeser dressing and croutons. No problem. When I get to the window, the polite young man hands me my order, making sure to hand me the Caeser dressing I ask for. 

""And the croutons?"" I ask. 
""You wanted croutons?""
""Yes. A Caeser salad always comes with croutons."" 
He runs back, taking a few moments to find croutons, and gives me an extra pack for my wait. 
""And a straw for my Coke please?"" He forgot my straw. No biggie.

There were 3 cars a head of me so of course it's going to take at least 30 min to even order. I ordered my sons breakfast ( sausage mc muffin with egg meal with a Dr Pepper and and extra sausage mc muffin with egg sandwhich. I ordered the egg mc muffin with no ham and a Diet Coke. Well we pay for our food and drive up to the next window to collect. I was handed the soft drinks first and of course the lady didn't speak English. I asked ""which is Diet Coke and which is Dr Pepper"" obviously a question so baffling it involved the manager. The manager and the drive through lady were bickering so long I thought ""wow I shouldn't have even asked such a complicated question"" so after bickering for a solid 10 min the two geniuses remade our drinks. They then closed the window totally forgetting about our food. I said excuse me can I please have my food as well??? What an awkward experience. Like I said I know it's fast food but there was zero professionalism at that McDonald's. So I get home only to realize they screwed up my sons sandwhiches. It's not the end of the world but I wasn't in the mood to sit in a drive through for 30 min, listen to the manager and drive through lady argue in Spanish and get my order screwed up.

It's happened to me several times, then I started cooking breakfast at home. Secondly, if you get service, they usually over cook the food, and it's usually the wrong items or missing items. This McD's has been here for over 20 years, and it's time to give another business a chance. You have failed your neighborhood and the customers you serve with your ""I don't give a crap"" attitude. I'll invest my money at the grocery store on a dozen eggs and a loaf of bread. It's cheaper and a heck of a lot better, and it takes the same amount of time to make.",2018-01-08

VbTAWusc9MpEdnqktonaNA,bS7dmk_OX5oIQvAhTb-bcw,o30cpvfgxHr6NQ5pvSb0Qw,2,0,0,Not impressed with this McDonald's. Figured the location might drive a better experience but this is not the case...ever. Have been treated pretty bad here by employees to the point that I contacted corporate. The inconsistency with filling orders is very frustrating and they lost a sale because they evidently shut down their milkshake machine at 9pm when they don't close till 11pm. Went up the road to Freddy's; theirs were still on and they got our business. It's unbelievable with the competition in this industry how they operate this way!,2018-10-29

When I get home and pull out my order the label says ""Triple ADD Mac Sauce"". Whatever, I will just pull off the two patties I don't want. I open it up and it's a double whatever. I really wanted a quarter pounder anyways so I pull a patty off and notice there's no Mac sauce. 

To summarize: Ordered quarter pounder with mac sauce, got a triple add mac sauce, and it was really a double no mac sauce. 

How do you mess up this badly?!?!?!?!",2018-12-11

I arrived and the cashier stated that they can only accept exact change. I informed the cashier that I did not want any bacon on the sausage biscuit and I did not want any eggs on the egg Mc Muffin. I called to inform them of their mistakes the cashier said, ""Well ma'am, that is how you ordered it."" I said, ""Ma'am, I did not order a ""sausage"" biscuit minus the sausage. I asked go speak to the manager, the cashier told me to hold on and the she ended the phone call. I was aware they were busy due to their breakfast rush, but I have managed several fast food restaurants and I never allowed the phone to ring more than 3 times; busy or slow. I finally spoke to a manager she seemed of age by the way she spoke.(late 30's-early or mid 40's) She mentioned that she just walked through the door but she used a tone of disgust as she spoke to me as if I caused a problem. She over talked me as I tried explain to her why I was upset, I did not want my money back I just wanted my order corrected. She told me about the rules for the offered special; I told her that was not the problem, the problem is the way the cashier attempted to handle the situation. She asked me what happened and as I began to tell her, she said, ""So, all I have to do is replace your order?"" I did not get a chance to tell her what was wrong and if I want my order replaced. I told her to give me my money back since due to her attitude. I am not sure if they hire people who they think are able to manage this location due to the neighborhoods that are in its surroundings. This entire location needs a renovation from the management to the employees.",2018-05-06

If you do not like your job, quit! Nobody is making you work here. You may have to google the term ""work"" to understand its true meaning. Find a job that you will like. Obviously flipping burgers at McDonalds is not rocket science but to the ones individuals working at this location, it is. I feel really feel sorry for these people b/c they will not achieve much in life besides flipping burgers at McDonalds. I mean, how hard is it to drop a basket of fries?? How hard is it to smile at a customer? How hard is it to show a little respect to the ones that pay you? It is really pathetic how employees act at this location.",2019-11-16

For years we used the one in Burlington City and we found that 9/10 our order was wrong, our fries cold, and overall it felt like no one really cared because it's just McDonalds.  We do not eat it much but when we do we want it to be fresh and hot because let's face it it kind of sucks to waste the calories on just OK food.

We started referring to this location as ""The Fancy McDonalds"" so we finally decided to drive the extra 5 mins to RT 541.  In this case we went inside (which never happens) but it was raining and I was hungry and the place was empty so we headed in.

They have touch screen ordering which I found easy to use and it was nice to browse the full list of items McDonalds offers.  Things I didn't know existed.  So we went crazy ordering! LOL They had a very large selection of breakfast for dinner and I love a bacon, egg and cheese on biscuit so I ordered two for $3 a piece.  

The inside was clean and modern, and had this kids table in the corner that was lighting up and cartoons on a screen TV next to it.  Most of our order headed to the table via a table number that was free to grab at the self order station so we didn't even have to hoover and wait for our food.  The manager bought our food over and welcomed us, he was very personable and sweet.  You can tell he does a nice positive job managing the younger staff that was there.  All our food was present, hot and delicious.  Needless to say this became our go to location.  Give it a try!",2019-06-01

Could not order anything with beef. Listen, a perennially broken ice cream machine is one thing but no beef? Lord, I have taken my business to Burger King or Wendy's whilst in the Mile Square.

Something I really love about Indy is that while the downtown district is extremely walkable, there aren't very many big fast food chains at all within walking distance. Which is rare for a big city, and this location is a little further removed from the pedestrian hustle and bustle. So I'm not advocating for more Mickey D's. No, no. But they do serve a purpose so let's just make this one better. 

Would love to see the building remodeled/revamped/glamped and given new management. It surely gets great business and has a great location. It has a lot of potential, but that's about it.",2019-09-28

The location remains, the building is completely NEW !! 

I dig the interior's functional layout and double lane drive thru. This location is 24 hrs. 

The seating options here are cool. Up dated bench and stool seating and lounge couches. 

The design concept is warm, dare I say earthy *gulp. Yes, I said it. Ordering and pick up counters flow in a functional manner. Table service is available.

It has been awhile since we have been to McDonalds, certainly less since adopting a plant based diet. Muriel, the GM greeted my son immediately. Commenting on how much he'd grown. I asked about Vegetarian options, currently Mcdonalds offers few. Muriel, shared that the company is looking to release new menu options by the end of 2019. 

As my son finished his meal, which was accurate and prompt, an employee brought him a piece of celebration cake. Simultaneously, a group of team members were clapping and singing happy birthday, to a team member. 

It was kind of, a hekk-of-a-day at McDonalds. Ha!

If your team can be calm, timely and accurate during the madness of a grand opening. I expect regular service days, will be a breeze.

Who gives McDonalds, five stars - me. Muriel and her team have repeatedly earned it, I am sorry I did not review this location sooner !",2019-09-28

The girl on the monitor let us know that there would be a wait, so we waited about two to three minutes before she was able to take our order. When we finally got to the window, you could tell that she was flustered and understaffed. But she worked professionally and she was polite. The food tasted like pretty much every other McDonald's experience, so I don't think we need to visit that.
