Now, before I start, I just want to say I work in customer service/industry work too so I know what's it like to not want to deal with people or still being at work when it's late and you'd rather be curled up in bed or whatever but I'll never take it out on the customers because I know that at the end of the day, I need it to pay my bills. I don't expect top-notch customer service either but this particular employee barely met the bare minimum. First off, I went in and that one employee was having a side conversation with someone for like 2 minutes before even taking a look at me. Second, I ordered hash browns and politely asked if she could make sure they're ""fresh"" because I once got old ones that were sitting in the oven for probably ages. They were really chewy and stale. Guess she thought that was such a hard and demanding request because the employee decided to go on a full blown 5 minute rant saying ""she wants them fresh. She's fresh. I don't care if she hears me (guess her friends or the other customers that were there were saying something). I said what I said. I don't care what she is. Chinese. Japanese. Blackiness."" Honestly baffled by this whole exchange because it was so unnecessary and rude. Treat people like how you want to be treated right? Do better please.",2019-12-19 04:30:48

Is it skim milk or whole milk ? Who knows? Just add more and serve it. If you ask for dark roast and aren't a regular customer who realizes it isn't dark roast they will serve you original brew. If you ask for an iced decaf coffee you never ever receive decaf it ALWAYS iS caffeinated coffee.

Associates more concerned with their cell phones and convos between each other. When you do get some ""help"" they give you shortness and attitude. This morning was actually the reason I decided to review this place. I drove up at about 530 am, and mind you, the hours are posted for opening at 5 A.M. when I got there,  there was 2 cars in front of me. They took a while to order and I just chalked it up to the usual Dunkin' biz. When I got to the drive thru speaker, I waited three minutes and said ""hello?"" No response. I drove up to the pickup windo and there is a woman, giving me a Michael Myers mean mug stare down and wouldn't open to talk to me or even apologize for the lack of service. This Dunkin' needs a serious overhaul. I won't be back until I hear or read differently about it. With so many BETTER options of coffee in Tampa Bay, I'd rather be late to work then to come to this place again. Stay away",2018-10-22 11:55:07

I was excited for it's opening and I've given it several chances and I never leave satisfied. They can't make iced coffees for shit and they are ALWAYS understaffed. I only continue to give it more chances because it's still so new and I understand they are still working out kinks etc. I went today to get a quick coffee just because it's so much closer than my usual Dunkin and I waited in line for 10 minutes! I got to the speaker and it was silence for 5 minutes until I finally said ""hello?!"" The girl responded immediately and said ""I'm sorry were understaffed be with you soon."" Sorry but I work in retail also and if you're understaffed please AT LEAST acknowledge your customer and tell them so they don't sit there and steep. I was so frustrated I left with no coffee. On all other occasions I've come here my coffee is never right, the food is usually stale and they never have the donuts you want. May I also add somehow their credit card machine for the drive though also never works?! They constantly take forever no matter what day or time it is. Don't come to this Dunkin if you're looking for good drinks, food or service because you will not be satisfied. And oh yeah management do a better job at staffing your team and not leaving your other members by themselves with no help at all!",2018-08-26 19:47:53
