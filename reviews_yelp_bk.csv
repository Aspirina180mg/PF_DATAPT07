Tried this location on August 9th, everything was fine until I pulled out of the drive through and opened a sandwich that appeared to have been sitting for a long while. Sandwich was cold, lettuce was wilted and the entire thing was sloppy. I filled out a survey immediately and was called by a BK employee who was nice and apologized. He explained that if I returned to this location with 30 days, they would make things right by covering a meal for me. I returned today, with my receipt w/ survey code, as instructed. Immediately, a small blonde girl with a BIG attitude came over and told me no, basically, and accused me of making up the survey code because there were letters in it.. saying it was impossible to give me what a higher up had assured me I'd receive. She did nothing to resolve the situation and had a crappy personality. She shouldn't be working in customer service. She continued to stand behind the counter and gossip about the interaction with the rest of the employees.. very professional. I paid for a meal again JUST so I could fill out a survey again with the survey code from my receipt. They tried not to give me a receipt.. so I had to request a duplicate before leaving. I'm livid.",2018-08-24

They were out of Sprite which is ok because I understand that maybe they were waiting for their truck or any number of things could have happened. I ordered a crispy chicken sandwich with cheese and I GOT a spicy chicken sandwich NO cheese.  Disappointed. I'm pregnant and I was really craving that.  .,2019-04-26

The most recent time that I came in, I ordered a 3-pc chicken tenders and large fries. I waited for at least 10 minutes, and people who came after me continued getting orders while I still waited. Apparently the workers behind the counter hadn't ""dropped"" the tenders in the fryer as they were told when I placed my order. It took me a total of about 15-20 minutes to finally get all of my order with no apologies about long wait. This is a regular occurrence every time I frequent this Burger King. It always seems that so many items aren't ready despite there being many workers behind the counter.

My food quality overall was decent, although I have received cold chicken fries during previous experiences. This time, since I had waited so long for tenders to be ""dropped,"" they did seem to be fresh. 

I really wish this particular Burger King focused on fast food actually being fast. It would make it a much better experience. Additionally the environment of the restaurant needs to be cleaner.",2019-03-09

Anyways, We got our food if you want to even call it that because all of it left the most disgusting taste in my mouth after every bite of french fry so needless to say I didn't eat but choked down 3 bites of each what i had because I was starving. The oil had to have been at least over a month old, if they do change it daily I'd be shocked and say there's just no hope except change brands of oil. Then the chicken sandwich it was the same thing the nasty after taste I thought I was literally going to get sick. Then there was the onion rings so gross doesn't even have onions in their rings. Now for the disgusting hamburger they put ketchup on there that was just dripping off the hamburger the sandwich was falling apart soggy getting ketchup all over the clothes on the floor and table. That was the most horrible experience I've ever had at a fast food restaurant. Used to be Burger King was one notch above all the rest of the fast foods not anymore. It's disgusting. They put allot of their money into the inside redecorating it but that's not where their money was well spent. No matter how nicely decorated the inside is it's the food that matters and theirs is hideous. Even with this new layout though it doesn't help them any as well because every table was dirty nowhere to sit so we finally found one who's to say if it was actually clean but we sat at the handicap table.

I'm not lying when I tell you I used a coupon for a chicken sandwich and fries-I offered up the code on the coupon-the clerk barely spoke any English-why are you working a drive thru window if you cannot communicate??

The person who took my order also prepared my order and the others'.  She was EXTREMELY slow and laid out all of the burgers and buns from other orders on her prep table, so essentially she was trying to fill them all at the same time.  This upset me even more to see this.  The manager ignored me while I made disappointed faces at her and the employee - and I even said, ""What's taking so long?""  When the manager finally gave me the meals, she didn't even apologize.  She just said, ""Would you like a dessert on the house?""  I told her NO because we were already running late for a movie since the order took so long. What she should have done was offer me a complete REFUND!

1) since when is it okay for people with long hair to not wear hairnets in the kitchen? Not a single employee wore one.

2) my 4 piece chicken tender meal and Starbucks crap drink came to $15. It is what it is but WOW. Not worth that price at all, and the chicken tenders were burnt to a crisp. Then come to find out the young man at the cash register had just automatically made it a meal AND tacked on the Starbucks drink, instead of asking - I didn't want a soft drink or soda, but that's fine, I found out when he gave me the receipt. THEN when I asked the woman who brought out the food if I could have my soft drink cup, she didn't say a single word to me. No acknowledgement, no ""oops,"" or ""sorry about that,"" or ""sorry about your wait,"" nothing. You need to severely consider working on your hiring and your customer service relations because not a single person showed any interest in customer service, or politeness to another human being. 

3) I paid my $15 bill in cash with a $20. We waited 5 to 7 minutes for my change because they were out of ones. No problem, but that is way to extreme of a wait in an airport, plus we saw the young man dancing in the back room and sitting around talking instead of focusing efforts on customer service. We offered to back it all out and pay with a card, but they said that wouldn't be convenient for the cashier.

Their competitor was too crowded so we came in to this clean restaurant and ordered 1 chicken sandwich and 1 combo so my husband could get his coffee.
The manager came to our table and said, they mistakenly made salad instead of sandwiches. I told her to leave it. We had 2 boxes of free chicken salads from Burger King. That's my 2nd visit in past 15 years at this chain restaurant. 
I'll return to this one for sure, not to expect another free box of chicken salad, just to return to their favor, as God said, take care of your neighbors, so good deeds need to be returned and more warmth of human nature will be exposed.",2018-01-28

The chairs at our table were all wobbly, and so was the table itself. It's not like they were so busy that they hadn't had time to clean, either, because we were the only customers in there when we arrived at 12:30, and while we were there, only two other people came in, ordered, and left. 
After we finished eating, our kids went to climb in the playground, which is why we'd chosen the place to begin with. One of the girls came out and said it was dirty in there; the other two didn't mind and played anyway. When our son came back from the men's room, he told us it was really gross.

I was in the area and had time to kill while i waited for my prescription so i figured i grab a bite with my kids. As soon as i walk in all you can hear is every employee fighting and not even acknowledging the customers. Finally after me and the one person in front of me get acknowledged the manager (as so he looked like it) walks over and says whos first. I ignored it and let it slide i then order my food and he was completely rude at the fact that he had to fix my order because of their error. Once we sat down all you hear is the arguing in spanish in the back as a native speaker it was completely rude and embarrassing for any person to be talking that way in an establishment they sounded like sailor mouths left and right. Please go to another BK and avoid this one at all costs.,2019-09-23

If you visit this location they will sell you old food that did not sell. This happened 2 me twice and now I'm the fool for giving them another chance. 

I ordered a whopper with nothing on it but ketchup and when i got home i got a burger with everything on it and it was cold,that tells me this this was not made when I was there since i live less than a minute away.

Now lets go back to my first experience i ordered a crispy chicken and a cheeseburger for my kid and when i got home both were frozen bricks and old.
Fries were cold. Given the time I'm now convinced they sell old food.

I don't know how they're cooked I'm assuming the pre-cooked beef is shoved in a taco shell then microwaved or baked because the shell was all bent and warped not to mention heart of a poker chip. After I choked the first one down I figured I'll chop some tomato a little sour cream and that ought to fix them right up. NOPE....
