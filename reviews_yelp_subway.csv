CYK_xEubeGE6fxwwwZqiyA,YazB4ROLMQ6-jvDfumvijA,zJdQwRbI7p0bH_60sfBSYA,5,0,0,This Subway location knows how to handle their business appropriately.  On two different occasions they have gone above and beyond for me.  Recently our area was hit hard with flooding and I needed to feed sand baggers on a budget.  The employees took care of me graciously unlike a nearby competitor of theirs.  These Subway employees know that word of mouth can make or break a business.  Great job and thank you! The sandwiches were great!,2017-05-03

1.  We, three of us, was about to enter the door of the establishment at 8:12 am when employee #1 who also was about to enter the door told us that they are not open yet.  We told her that her posted business hours opened at 7:00 am.  She was shocked.
2.  I ordered the daily special foot-long for $6.00 and employee #1 told me $7.75.  Then I asked if their tax was over 10% and she said ""no"".  So I said, if the tax rate was 10%, then the maximum of my sandwich would only be $6.60 and how could she account for the balance.  A total ""deer in the headlights"" experience for her.
3.  Then my friend ordered a fancier sandwich and his price was $5.75.
4.  Finally my last friend ordered his sandwiches and employee #2 said that they are out of bread and it won't be ready for another 30 minutes.

Truly amazed with the quality of employees hired.",2017-04-03

The last time we went here we were very angry at our service. The guy taking our order was very rude. My mom asked for a 6 inch tuna sandwich. He put the cheese on, then the tuna. That's supposed to be it until we add our toppings. He proceeded to but extra cheese on without asking. My mom told him he already put cheese on and he responded with ""I know but it makes the sandwich taste better"". Once he pulled the sandwich out the toaster, we asked for light mustard and regular amount of mayo. He put it on and didn't spread it, so when we asked for him to spread it he took a piece of lettuce and mixed to mayo and mustard together. He then continued to be rude until me and my mom left. Didn't figure out his name but he was a caucasain man around 5'9 with dark hair. Hopefully your service will be better than mine

I went to this location Friday, July 14, 2017. The girl behind the counter was a little quiet yet very polite. It wasn't the quickest, especially since no one else was in line, but none the less, I had a great sandwich for under $5. So no problem yet. I felt like my experience was decent enough to come back again. Fast forward to the next day (7/15/2017). My boyfriend and I enter the store to one girl working by herself and no customers in the store. The girl was wiping down tables as I said hi and approached the counter, all I got back was quick eye contact and mayyyybe a slight nod.. Anyways, I stand at the counter and wait. It's very clear that we were not a priority to this girl, as she didn't come to help us order. After a few moments, I even politely ask if the store is still open since no one was approaching the counter to help us (hoping that this would urge the girl to assist us.) she answers yes but continues on cleaning. At this point, we had been standing at the counter for 3 whole minutes waiting for this girl to wipe down Every. Single. Table. Now, I know this isn't a crazy long time, but I'm beginning to get frustrated as there was no ""I'll be right with you"" or a ""Hang tight for a minute"" and keep in mind, we didn't even get a ""hello"" or ""welcome"". Plus, there was literally no one else in the store. Shouldn't the customers be at least a little bit of a priority? This girl takes her sweet time without addressing us at all and goes into the back room. It's now been over 5 minutes and I'm assuming she'll come out to help us now, but after a few more moments, I decide it's too late. I left the store before the girl even came out from the back..

The restaurant was clean, and the food neatly on display appeared fresh. The store had just a couple of customers, and that was surprising being it was during the height of lunch hour. The gentleman behind the counter greeted me with, Hello, it's been a long time. He was the owner he had introduced himself years ago when I was a regular customer. I ordered my food a Spicy Italian on Herbs and Cheese roll and had requested my sauce be placed on the bread. There were some new toppings, so I was checking them out and not paying attention to the construction of my sub. The man asked sauce on top; I replied with ""Did you put a good bit on the roll,"" I order it on the roll to help prevent it from dripping on my clothes. He made an angry face and proceeded to lift the contents off the roll and show me, I asked if there was a problem and he went on to reprimand me for having asked for a little on the bread, I may have used the word little but was only wanting to know if he put any on the bread because I wasn't paying attention and so that I knew there was sauce on it. There was no one in line behind me, yet so I was taken back by his giving me attitude. I took my sub to go, it was good but I have always been respectful to this guy and even tolerated his bad talking Subway corporation in the past because ""they don't support the owners just have demands on them"" I had given him frequent receipt reviews all positive and even did a yelp review years ago that was also very positive. A woman was at the register and was very kind, thanking me for coming in. When I exited the store, it was the last time I will ever go there. Maybe this explains how on a summer day during the lunch rush near a theme park, the store was not busy? After posting my briefly of displeasure with on the receipt survey I received an email from the owner, it was a boilerplate message saying he shared my feedback with his team to improve customer service.

I don't come to Subway much, but when I do it is usually for a five-dollar foot long or an additional special that they run. The sandwiches here are just fine and get the job done. 

I do prefer this location as it's clean and the sandwiches have always been consistent.",2017-05-07

Every time I go the same people were working, and I believe they were the owners and their kids. They are VERY cheap and will make you ask multiple times for a couple of slices of cucumbers. The ingredients are just barely brown and they still sell them, vegetables are soggy and brown.

This subway has not disappointed me, yet! The building is located in a strip mall, but parking is never a problem!!

The inside is very spacious, clean, and always smells like fresh baked subway bread. There are outlets along the wall, near the tables, so you're able to bring your laptop or charge your phone.

The employees are very attentive and work as a team to get everyone in line, taken care of. I never had to repeat myself and they always inform me of the daily deals, before they take my order. They currently have a $6.50 6inch, chips, and a drink deal. The deal is for a different sandwich everyday of the week.

I'm redundant so always order the footlong, grilled chicken breast and 3 double chocolate chip cookies. I also order a drink. The cookies are always baked to perfection. I've had past experiences, with other restaurants, serving hard or stale cookies, so I reallt appreciate the cookie quality. Some may call me the cookie monster.

The soda is always very crips and the machines are very clean. I can tell, from experience, that they clean their machines daily. I will definitely make this my first choice on days when I'm eating takeout on my lunch break.

Subway, eat fresh!!",2017-03-16

Took it home. Went to eat it about an hour later. It was only missing one ingredient -- THE TUNA! Had NONE whatsoever! Had secretary call the store. Thought for sure they'd say, ""So sorry. Come on in and we'll make it up to you."" The manager told us it was ""corporate policy"" to never issue refunds without ""proof"" there was something wrong the order (as if two sworn witnesses weren't proof). Called Subway corporate. They said they had no such rule, but they didn't seem to care whether the individual store owner ripped off Subway customers. Subway's attitude = ""Tough sh-t!""",2017-12-12

Most of the time I order a veggie delight and at this store there is never enough toppings.  Been a huge subway fan for thirty years. Over the years I have seen the bread change and less toppings to my dismay.  But this store takes the cake on that.   Disappointed every time.  I still go because it is close.  I would never go there if I had more healthy options near by.   They would have a whole lot more customers if they took the subs seriously and maintained a dependable product!",2019-02-07

But tonight i went and there was a older lady and the owner was in. The older lady didn't speak english very fluently, which is fine, but my issue is that she rushed through my order, not even listening, making me repeat myself several times... not because she didn't hear me but because she wasn't paying attention, completely stingy and cheap on vegetables I requested in my sand-which. When id ask for extra vegetables she acted like i troubled her so much. She was messy with the sauces and PUT THE WRONG SAUCE IN MY SANDWICH. The owner just watched and didn't care to help her or intervene. Then asks me ""can we just scrape it off?"" No sir.. you can not. It was extremely frustrating because they lacked good customer service and kindness. A simple my apologies would of been alright for me but they thought it was okay to just give dirty looks, talk rudely, and in their own language. Which i must add is extremely inappropriate especially coming from the owner. I did not feel welcomed and felt very disrespected. Especially because i come to this location so often. Only one employee actually is kind and friendly and LISTENS!!!! It was about 40 minutes to close, and I understand people want to go home.. but from the owner and staff member.. totally unacceptable. My suggestion is only go there when the sweet girl is working, aside from that youll get half assed service.",2019-04-24

I'm a Veteran who uses a cane, and one time I was there and the floor was freshly mopped, and one of the employees came over and made sure I was able to cross the wet floor safely. If that doesn't speak volumes about their customer service, I don't know what does. And now that I can order on the app, pay, and then come in to pick up...that's a HUGE plus.
